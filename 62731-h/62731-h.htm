<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Because</span> of their pivotal positions, politically
and geographically; because of their
tempting adaptation to colonization; because
of their vast proven and hidden resources; because
of their divers other advantages, too
numerous to mention, the Balkan States have
been, are and will continue to be, as once a
certain writer so aptly put it, the “Powder
Box of Europe.”</p>

<p>Constant conflict, however, has stunted their
progress, and it has only been within the past
few years that these lands&mdash;conspicuously
lacking in the arts of peace, but overcrowded
with types and replete with wonderful scenery,
their histories sated with war and romance&mdash;have
begun to be disclosed to the travelling
world. Only within the past few years their
outlying districts have been connected with
their business centres by telegraphic communication;
only within the past few years railroads
have been constructed, steamship lines inaugurated
and hotel accommodations perfected.
Yesterday their peoples were almost barbaric;
to-day they are more highly civilized and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>finely cultured than perhaps we are inclined
to admit; to-morrow they may be famous.
They have been makers of history for our
forebears and us; they will be makers of history
for posterity and its children.</p>

<p>It is to assist the reader to frame a more
just opinion of that southeastern corner of
Europe, “The Lands of the Tamed Turk,”
and those who people it, that this volume of
personal observations and experiences of travel,
interspersed with brief bits of history, is offered.</p>

<p>The author begs to tender his appreciation
to Mr. Nox McCain for the use of several unusual
photographs published herewith; also to
the editors of <cite>The Metropolitan Magazine</cite>,
New York, <cite>Travel Magazine</cite>, New York, and
<cite>The National Geographic Magazine</cite>, Washington,
with whose kind permission are herein
reprinted, <em>verbatim</em>, certain parts of special
articles on the Balkan States by the author,
and some of the illustrations accompanying
them, which appeared in the periodicals mentioned
above.</p>

<p class="center">WHY THE BALKANS?</p>

<p class="hang50">The Rundreise Ticket&mdash;Why the Balkans?&mdash;When and Where
English is Heard&mdash;Why Not the Balkans?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a week we had remained in London,
trying furiously to make up our minds which
part of the Continent would interest us most.
In the evenings at dinner we laid bare our
ideas collected during the day, and endeavoured
to formulate plans, but those countries
which one favoured to visit seemed in no wise
to appeal to the other. By the end of the week
we had about completed our inventory of the
tourable parts of Europe without one of us
being inoculated with a special desire to revisit
any of them. Then some one suggested,
“Why not the Balkans?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>That seemingly insignificant little interrogation
cut short our evening convocations in
London as abruptly as one would snuff the
wick of a candle, for inside of forty-eight
hours we had purchased our “Rundreise” and
“Hapag” tickets and were speeding Vienna-ward.</p>

<p>To the seasoned traveller the following brief
explanation may seem a trifle superfluous but,
at the same time, it may be the means of saving
a world of bother and inconvenience, no
small item of expense and an incalculable loss
of temper to the uninitiated&mdash;especially in
countries where an English-speaking individual
is regarded with no little curiosity.</p>

<p>The “Rundreise,” or “Round-trip-ticket,”
is an institution in itself. On it you may
travel, for example, from London to Constantinople
and return to London by way of
any route or in any direction. You may go to
Paris, to Cologne, and up the Rhine to Frankfort;
thence to Vienna, Buda-Pesth, Constantinople,
and return by way of the Levant and
the Riviera. There are a hundred different
routes by which to go and come, a hundred
interesting parts of countries to pass through,
a hundred beautiful cities to visit. You may
travel by rail or by boat, first, second or third
class&mdash;according to the price paid&mdash;but you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>must return to the starting-point, or, at all
events, you will have paid for that privilege,
and it concerns but you if you do not care to
avail yourself of it.</p>

<p>The one serious proviso of the “Rundreise
ticket,” and one that will be at once a drawback
to some and a boon to others, is that no
luggage may be checked on it. But the less
luggage and the smaller the assortment of
clothes taken for travel in the Balkans the
better&mdash;providing, of course, your mission
does not necessitate your being dined and
wined by the nobility and diplomats.</p>

<p>The “Hapag ticket” is, in the language of
the Magyar, of the same general specie as the
“Rundreise.”</p>

<p>And in contemplating such a trip through
the Southeast of Europe, two important questions
naturally arise: Why? and why not the
Balkans?</p>

<p>To the first there are many convincing replies.
The Balkan States have been, for two
thousand years, the “Powder Box” of Europe.
The Greeks, and, after them, the Romans,
came and saw and conquered; the
Venetians, for a time, swept all before them
along the coast of the Adriatic; for five hundred
years the Turks, thirsting for the blood
of the Christians, have attacked, have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>repulsed and have attacked again, shocking
the entire world with their atrocious massacres.
One need not hunger for history in travelling
through the Balkans. In addition, its
peoples are primitive, their customs are curious
and their methods mediæval. They are
backward and unsophisticated in everything
but war&mdash;and that word “war” has been
the slogan in the “Near East” for centuries.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the territory has been left
uninvaded by the frantic tourist,&mdash;in fact,
an American is regarded as a wonder to look
upon, and his harmless little camera, aimed
promiscuously, is as apt to conjure up a crowd
of stary-eyed, open-mouthed, inquisitive natives
as the perpetration of a political tragedy.</p>

<p>And woe is he who cannot speak German,
or at least enough of that language to ask the
questions necessary to travel, for the days of
“personally conducted” tours through the
Balkans have yet to come. He may speak
French fluently but, exclusive of the diplomatic
circles, it would be as much to his advantage
to adhere to American slang. The
exceptions, however, invariably prove the rule,
and it is when English is least expected to be
heard that its utterance is the most heartily
appreciated.</p>

<p class="caption">“A CROWD OF STARY-EYED, OPEN-MOUTHED, INQUISITIVE
NATIVES.”</p>
</div>

<p>The head-waiter of the hotel in Belgrade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>had been a deck steward on a trans-Atlantic
liner and of course surprised us upon our arrival
with a generous speech in English.</p>

<p>The hotel proprietor in Sophia spoke nine
languages with great fluency and, in addition,
had been studying English from newspapers.
He had so far advanced in the mastery of the
grammar as to have been able to read Dickens
(whether he understood it or not is another
matter), but I had the honour of being the
first English-speaking person upon whom he
had had the opportunity of airing his pronunciation.
Considering the fact that he had
never before indulged his English in conversation
he butchered it to a remarkably small
degree, and was understood without an excessive
amount of difficulty.</p>

<p>As another example of this clandestine
knowledge of the English language throughout
the Balkan Peninsula, I was standing one
evening on the <em>molo</em> at Ragusa, watching two
fishermen load their small boats with nets and
other implements of the catch. At the stern
of their craft was displayed a large and cumbersome
lantern having a powerful reflector.
I questioned the rower in German, such as it
was, as to the use of this paraphernalia, and, as
I had not heard a word of my mother-tongue
in the town&mdash;in fact, all along the Dalmatian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>coast&mdash;my auricular nerves suffered a profound
but agreeable shock when the man replied,
“The sardines follow the light while
we lead ’em into the nets.” He had been a
sailor and had visited almost every port in the
United States as well as in England.</p>

<p>And, why <i>not</i> the Balkans?</p>

<p>In place of the mountain-trails and muddy
cart-roads of a few years ago there are now
railway lines that form a network through the
most interesting sections, and travel is facilitated
proportionately. The scenery is as picturesque
as any in Europe, while the touch
of colour, in the garb of the peasants mingling
with the variegated uniforms of the always
conspicuous army, adds an unalloyed charm
seldom enjoyed along the time-honoured travel
routes of the Continent. Good hotels, at
which the food is excellent and well prepared,
may be found in the cities, and the accommodations,
if not luxurious, cleanly and comfortable.</p>

<p>As late as 1853-54 not a single telegraphic
line existed beyond the Austrian frontier.
Along the highway from Belgrade to Constantinople,
through Nisch and Sophia, messages
from the Western courts to the Sublime
Porte were carried by dare-devil riders at a
speed which sacrificed horse-flesh regardlessly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>A notable achievement was the ride along this
route of one Colonel Townley, who covered
eight hundred miles in the incredibly short
time of five days and ten hours. To-day the
“Orient Express” eats its tortuous way tri-weekly
from Calais to Constantinople, crossing
Europe from edge to edge, in a fraction
over four days.</p>

<p>Hardships of travel through the near East
have vanished, although, in countries so backward
and so seldom visited by the sightseer,
it would be highly improbable that inconveniences
would not be encountered. But these
inconveniences are doubly cancelled by the
pleasures and sensations of vibrating between
the beauty-spots of pugnacious little principalities,
whose histories have been written so
indelibly with blood upon the pages of the
world’s progress.</p>

<p class="center">BUDA-PESTH AND BELGRADE</p>

<p class="hang50">Buda-Pesth and Its Language&mdash;From Buda-Pesth to Belgrade&mdash;The
Servian Passport System&mdash;First Impressions of Belgrade&mdash;Garden
Spots in and about the Servian Metropolis.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Buda-Pesth</span>, with its imposing buildings,
its kaleidoscopic market scenes and its impossible
language, seems to be the Eastern jumping-off
place, so to speak, of Continental
travel. It is the suburb of Europe; but what
a fascinating suburb it is, to be sure! Its architectural
beauty is unsurpassed; its situation
unrivalled, with the Danube coursing between
the old city, Buda, and the new city, Pesth;
its parks are veritable bowers of refreshing
green; its cafés are interesting and its military
music delightful. It is the Mecca of Magyar
aristocracy and, if one can infer aught from
natural proof, it has been well adopted.</p>

<p>But the language! The atrocious combinations
of vowels and consonants fairly numb
your powers of pronunciation. In order that
your attempts to even read the signs may be
made all the more tantalizing, our own, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Roman, alphabet is used to muddle the brain
of the foreign visitor. When we see the writings
of the Chinese or the Greeks, for instance,
we are not inclined to regard these tongues as
altogether unmasterable, but to behold the letters
of <i>our</i> alphabet so haphazardly jumbled
together and capped with many accents, grave
and acute, seems bitter indeed. Taking it all
in all the Hungarian tongue seems analogous
to a waste of talent.</p>

<p class="caption">THE FISCHER RAMPARTS, PESTH.</p>
</div>

<p>One delightful evening I summoned my
courage and ventured into a trolley-car, hoping
that it might eventually take me near the Casino
of the principal park. It did, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirabile
dictu</i>, and I alighted. But a week in Buda-Pesth
had not passed without many and varied
experiences. In order to be doubly cautious
and not mistake my car to return to the hotel&mdash;for,
luckily, this one made the park its terminus
and returned by the same route&mdash;I unsheathed
my note book and copied then and
there the name of the route from a sign on the
side of the car. Fortified with this valuable
data I was prepared to enjoy the evening with
reckless abandon, mingling with the crowds,
listening to the music and concerning myself
not at all as to the way to get home, for I
had only to wait until a car came along
marked <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><a lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">“Városlíget-Eskü-Tér-Podmaniczy-Utcka,”</a>
whatever that means, and I would be
among friends.</p>

<p>If you do not stop to look at the signs&mdash;for
what is a city of this era without a host of
glaring, gilded advertisements&mdash;Buda-Pesth
is just as enticing, but on a somewhat smaller
scale, as Vienna, and at the end of a fortnight
we were loth to leave. As the next slip of our
Rundreise book read “Belgrade,” we jammed
ourselves into one of the dusty compartments
of a crowded railway train bound for the Servian
frontier.</p>

<p>Among our fellow-passengers was an aged,
rheumatic Jewish woman, travelling from
Vienna to Constantinople, who became very
sociable, despite her affliction, and lighted one
cigarette from the stub of the other as she
unveiled to us her past history in broken German.</p>

<p>The railway line from Buda-Pesth to Belgrade,
traversing the great Hungarian steppes,
is devoid of attractive scenery and the journey
of seven hours becomes somewhat tiresome,
especially if the season is summer with its accompanying
heat and the train is uncomfortably
crowded. Agriculture along the route
seems to be very much on the wane, but enormous
herds of long-horned cattle, flocks of
sheep and tens of thousands of pigs tell succinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the product of that portion of Hungary.
Now and again you may see a native
driver in heavy leather boots, white petticoat,
or smock, to his knees, and a derby hat (not
a very dignified-appearing combination of apparel),
tending a large flock of unusually huge
geese, tapping the laggards deftly with his
long willow switch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_017"><img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="400" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE ELIZABETH BRIDGE,&mdash;BUDA IN THE BACKGROUND.</p>
</div>

<p>The minute you cross the Danube at the
Servian frontier you begin to feel the influence,
although a waning one, of a nation that has
been struggling desperately for hundreds
of years to regain her lost provinces&mdash;the
Turks. It is not so noticeable in Servia as in
Bulgaria, not so noticeable in Bulgaria as in
Bosnia and the Herzegovina, but it is there,
nevertheless; the sullen, silent suffering of a
nation of stoics, whose forefathers were defeated
in their murderous attempts to Mohammedanize
Europe only at the very gates of
Vienna itself.</p>

<p>The fact that Servia entertains exaggerated
fears for her own is brought to the notice of
the traveller&mdash;and forcibly, too&mdash;at Zemlin,
on the Austrian side of the Danube River,
opposite Belgrade. At this point one of King
Peter’s ominous-looking arms of the law, resplendent
in epaulets and gold cord, boards
each and every train from the west. Although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>his trailing sword appears to be no little hindrance
to his ease in getting about, his temper
remains unruffled and he examines with polite
suspicion the passports of all who expect to
leave the train at the Servian capital. The
name of the owner of the passport is jotted
down on a piece of paper which, later, in the
depot, is handed surreptitiously to a pair of
warlike individuals who guard the exit to the
street, while the customs officials are demanding
excuses for the contents of your grips.
Between these two warriors you must pass out
from the depot and give them your name,
which is forthwith checked off the list previously
furnished by the portly train inspector.</p>

<p>But this is not all.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at the hotel you are handed
an information blank, which must be filled in
with your name, address, occupation, religion,
where you came from, how long you expect to
remain in the city, your ultimate destination
and such data as would facilitate the authorities
in bringing you to earth in case you attempted
to cut short the life of the King or
incited the natives to revolt.</p>

<p>One of these blanks, for you must fill in two,
is kept at the hotel; the other is sent to police
headquarters. No matter how insignificant you
may imagine you are when in your mother-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>country,
you are under the eagle eye of the
government continuously in Servia. Your
every move is watched and made a note of.
It matters not even if you change to another
hotel; the police are immediately notified to
that effect. You are branded as a suspicious
character and will remain so until you prove it
or leave the country, vindicated.</p>

<p>Your first impressions of the metropolis of
Servia are apt to be a bit disappointing, and
especially so if you arrive at night, for Belgrade
is anything but an imposing city, even
in the daytime. You are driven rather recklessly
through streets of very uneven cobbles,
miserably lighted and apparently abandoned
by human beings. The business, and, at the
same time, residential part of the city, in which
your hotel is located, looks down from the crest
of a hill upon the squalid, old Turkish quarter
on one side, from which emanates a veritable
vapour of highly seasoned cookery, and the
poor Servian district and warehouses on the
other. To the west, on a cliff overlooking the
junction of the Danube and the Save, are the
Kalemagden Park and the old fortress, the
guns of the latter having been long since
silenced by the Treaty of Berlin of 1878,
which forbade Servia fortifying her Austrian
frontier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>“The cheerful boulevards of Belgrade,” as
one author earnestly puts it, may have been
in existence at the time the phrase was coined,
but I very much doubt it, because of the dearth
of evidence of these alleged “boulevards” ever
having deserved such flattery.</p>

<p>This Kalemagden Park, however, is one of
the few beauty spots of the Servian capital.
Another is in the vicinity of the <em>konak</em>, or palace,
of King Peter, in the eastern portion of
the city. The street borders one end of the
<em>konak</em> and continues past the garden and lawn
which the building faces: if it were not for the
gates being guarded constantly by soldiers one
would hardly imagine the edifice to be the residence
of a royal household. The mutinous
murder of King Alexander and Queen Draga
in 1903 occurred in the old <em>konak</em>, later demolished
by order of the present ruler, which stood
in front of the new palace but facing the gardens
and the street.</p>

<p>Three miles to the east of the city is located
Topchidere Park, the beautiful country-seat of
the ill-fated Prince Alexander, who was but
one victim of the many infamously successful
plots of the Servian regicides. His chalet
stands on the opposite side of the roadway
from the little chapel, and in the garden his
stone tea-table is still preserved. Above it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>spread the branches of a monstrous tree of
some three hundred years of age, famous from
the fact that from its massive limbs the invading
Turks were wont to hang their Christian
victims. Near by is the country estate of the
present Crown Prince, with stables and kennels
containing his favourite horses and dogs.</p>

<p>Topchidere is the improvised country club
of the Belgraders, and many are the social
functions given in its casino&mdash;if I may apologize
for the use of the word “casino” in describing
the ramshackle frame house of carousal
in the Park. But the gardens are really beautiful,
and are kept in excellent condition by
state prisoners detailed to work in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the seeker of health and of pleasure, to
the lover of the beautiful in art and in nature,
to the reveller in gayety and luxurious living,
Servia as a travel territory is null and void.
It is a country of interest to the public only
so long as it continues to bask in the limelight
as a disturber of Balkan peace. It is the
tool of Russia, the enemy of Austria, the contempt
of Bulgaria and the hatred of Turkey.
Indeed its only true friend may be said to be
its relative&mdash;miniature Montenegro. If the
Balkan Peninsula is the “Powder Box” of
Europe, Servia certainly deserves to be called
the “Percussion Cap” of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

<p class="caption">THE NATIVE SERVIAN HEAD-DRESS.</p>
</div>

<p>To the student the Servians are a nation of
types; as a race they are gifted by nature with
unusual powers of observation, shrewdness
and strength of character, but from the fact of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>their having been so long oppressed has arisen
a disposition to concealment and even absolute
distrust. They are patriotic and loyal to a
marked degree, which may account, in part,
for their emotional proclivities. They are absolutely
fearless, but this fearlessness assumes at
times a tinge of the <em>opera bouffe</em>, as in the
late controversy with Austria, which leads us
Americans to think of them as a nation of
charlatans.</p>

<p>But I digress. It is not my desire to enter
into any rehearsals of the political conditions
in the pivotal Near East. I exhaled a deep-breathed
oath when this volume was commenced
to confine my writings herein to the
travelling through and brief descriptions of
these “Lands of the Tamed Turk,” introducing
such history as might seem romantic and
interesting and instructive enough to be absorbed
by the reader.</p>

<p>Only since the final suppression of the
Turks have the Servians “found themselves,”
so to speak, and the rapid rise of the nation
has been remarkable. In the early years of
the nineteenth century, before its revolt under
the leadership of George Petrovitch&mdash;Kara,
or Black George, as he was called by the
Turks&mdash;Servia could not boast of a single
schoolhouse; there was not even a wagon road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>in the whole country, except what remained
of the ancient Roman highway between Belgrade
and Nisch; because the Turks forbade
the building or even repairing of houses of
Christian worship, the churches were, for the
most part, in miserable ruin; the entire population
at that time was scarcely larger than
that of the single city of Detroit to-day. Then
Servia was merely a province of Turkey, governed
by a Vizir sent from Constantinople.
The country was not only the seat of internal
friction, but tribes, in rebellion against the
Sultan, exploited the land as a private estate.</p>

<p>But listen to the changes of a hundred years.</p>

<p>As I write, Servia maintains eight hundred
and sixty elementary schools for boys and a
hundred and fifty for girls; fourteen middle
grade schools with, and twelve without, classical
departments; six high-schools for girls;
two technical academies; two schools for teachers;
one commercial college; a school of agriculture;
a military academy; and an university.
Public instruction is free and compulsory.
Of the twelve hundred and seventy-eight
towns and villages throughout the country
the important ones are connected by rail,
and telegraphic communication exists between
most of the others.</p>

<p>The contemptible pig still constitutes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>chief article of export, but the raising of
swine, instead of the cultivation of the soil,
although the latter is by no means unprolific,
has been handed down from generation to generation
as an ingenious method of the Servians
for saving the products of their country from
the destructive raids of the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In some
districts, however, fruits and cereals are cultivated
and exported in abundance. Many
thousands of cases of plums find their way to
France annually, whence they are re-exported
to America, and sold under the label of French
products. From this fruit is pressed the
national drink of Servia, <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">slivivitz</i>, a sort of
plum brandy, which, when imbibed freely,
produces most grotesque effects&mdash;so I am
told.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> To those of the Mohammedan faith pork is
a forbidden delicacy.</p></div>

<p>Although the whole kingdom covers little
more than twice the area of the state of New
Jersey, the regular army consists of some
twenty thousand men. The organization of
it, however, is based upon a law enacted in
1893 which, if executed, would place in the
field three hundred and thirty-five thousand
men, but financial stringencies have curbed the
application of this statute. For every Servian
between the ages of twenty and thirty, military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>duty for two years in the regular army is compulsory;
and during the remaining years of
his middle life he is classed in the first, second
or third divisions of the reserves, according to
his age.</p>

<p>Belgrade itself, the capital of the country,
has a population of eighty thousand, being
about the size of Hartford, Connecticut, and
it is a singular fact, as well as an amusing one,
that no less than two thousand of this number
are policemen. These guardians of the peace,
who are at the same time units of the army,
are well-drilled and are housed in military
barracks.</p>

<p class="caption">DRINKING A FRIENDLY GLASS OF <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">SLIVIVITZ</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Naturally, the army is the phase of Servian
life most often met with in the capital. You
will see it on every hand, at all hours and
clothed in every conceivable colour of uniform.
It throngs the parks and takes complete and
indisputable possession of the cafés; in which
the prices of beverages advance simultaneously
with the tuning-up of the gypsy orchestras.
Should you drive out to one of the rather
ridiculous race-meets you will notice that the
army-officers’ race is the most important event
on the programme. Like as not, upon such an
excursion, the King will drive past you, bowing
graciously; although the races are comparatively
crude affairs, he and the other members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> of the
royal household are ardent devotees
of the sport.</p>

<p>At the race course the army lines the fence
bordering the track, while half a dozen heavily
equipped peasants in black alpaca caps vie
with each other as to the speed of their respective
mounts. At one meet which I attended, a
rider was thrown within a short distance from
the tape, which his horse was about to cross
ahead of the other contestants by two hundred
yards. But his mind was set upon winning
the race by fair means or foul and, picking
himself out of the dust, he bravely endeavoured
to cross the line on foot in advance of
the fast-approaching cloud of rivals. Upon
his failure to do so a heated discussion immediately
arose as to whether the horse won the
race or the rider lost it.</p>

<p>For a Balkan city Belgrade is exceptionally
apt in acquiring the ways and “means”
of the Westerner. As the traveller is about
to leave the hotel to take a train a hall bell is
rung, followed by a general mustering of all
hands, from the head clerk to the cook’s helper,
each of whom expects to receive some token of
appreciation for services rendered. I suppose
I had helped at least sixteen to establish themselves
in business, and was just about to make
a second start for the depot when one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>confederates came running breathlessly
towards me. Would I be good enough to
wait just <i>one</i> moment because the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zimmer
mädchen</i> (and Heaven knows I tipped <i>her</i>
munificently each time she brought me warm
water for shaving or lined the marble bathtub
with a sheet&mdash;and in Belgrade a bath
costs seventy-five cents, anyway) was on her
way downstairs? But time was precious with
me and as I drove away I heard, faintly, the
tardy and disappointed <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zimmer mädchen</i> clattering
along the flagstone hall.</p>

<p>I even saw an automobile, of uncertain vintage
and questionable parentage, in Belgrade,
honking its noisy way through the crowds of
gaping peasants near the market.</p>

<p>And in the word “market” I have unconsciously
mentioned one of the most interesting
sights to be had during a visit to a Slavonic
city. Every day is “market-day” in Belgrade,
but on Sunday mornings the bizarre
scene is augmented by peasants in holiday
garb from all the surrounding country-side,
while Turkish “boze”-sellers (this word
“boze” is not to be conflicted with the American
slang expression which signifies intoxicating
liquors) peddle about the contents of their
buckets, shrieking the avowed virtues of their
stock in trade. This “boze,” a sort of sweetened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
oatmeal water, is freely consumed in
Servia by shopkeepers, artisans and peasants.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_035"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="450" /></a>
<p class="caption">A “BOZE” PEDDLER, BELGRADE.</p>
</div>

<p>But I must withhold the description of a
typical market scene in the Balkans, and devote
a certain amount of space to it in connection
with the Bulgar capital of Sophia
where one of the most interesting markets in
the world is held on Friday of each week.</p>

<p>Of the customs of the country there are
many which are quaint and singular, especially
among the peasant population, but only
a few of the more common ones will bear
description.</p>

<p>In the Servian orthodox church there are
a hundred and eighty feast days in the year,
the continued observance of which places business
in a state of chaos. Divorce is easily obtained,
and for the slightest cause, through
the ecclesiastical tribunals, and it carries with
it no social disgrace; but to wed a cousin, no
matter how distant, is attended with absolute
ostracism.</p>

<p>Instead of bride’s-maids at a wedding the
Servians employ two <em>kums</em>, or godfathers,
each of whom is compelled by custom to give
the bride a dress-length of silk. A particularly
significant honour is bestowed upon the
<em>dever</em>, who acts in the capacity of the best man
at the marriage ceremony. He carries a bouquet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wears a white sash and other ludicrous
regalia, and for no reason whatever must he
leave the bride for an instant throughout the
day of the wedding.</p>

<p>As a general rule the wife is older than the
husband and the bridegroom’s relatives have
preference over those of the bride. The bride
herself is regarded as little more than a household
slave.</p>

<p>Each regiment of the army, like each
Servian family, revels in the protection of a
patron saint, and the celebration of the <em>slava</em>,
or patron saint’s day, of a regiment is the only
occasion of the year upon which all ranks of
the army are considered socially equal. In the
family the <em>slava</em> usually takes place upon the
anniversary of that family’s conversion to
Christianity, and on that day it is the custom
to call upon one’s friends whose <em>slava</em> it is.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE PRISHTINA COSTUME, WORN BY SERVIAN WOMEN ON FEAST
DAYS.</p>
</div>

<p>Characteristic of every Slavonic nation is
its national dance, and the Servians, not to be
outdone in this respect by their cousins, boast
of what they call the “Kola,” an extremely
picturesque variety of the terpsichorean art,
partly adapted from the Russian and partly
invented by themselves. This “Kola” is
danced upon the least provocation, and at
every function. It matters little where they
may be; in the streets of Belgrade or tending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>their flocks in the fields, if a group of Servians
feel a “Kola” coming on they must give vent
to their enthusiasm. It is danced upon the
field of battle by the soldiers, and the King
leads it at every state ball. At first sight it
seems ridiculous, almost childish, and especially
so when danced at one of the royal
functions where gray-whiskered diplomats of
all nations, high officials of state in uniform
and be-jewelled leaders of Servian society trail
like a kaleidoscopic serpent in the wake of the
King, as he twists and turns up and down the
polished floor of the great ball-room in the
palace. But it seems to wax more and more
fascinating and impressive the more often one
sees it danced.</p>

<p>I was returning by carriage one warm,
humid afternoon, from the cool environs of
Topchidere Park, when I noticed a regiment
of Servian soldiery drilling on the parade
ground near one of the barracks. Suddenly
the order to stack arms was given. Two of
the privates rushed with all possible speed to
the barracks and returned with a couple of
violins. As they commenced the typical
Slavonic music of the “Kola” the nine hundred
and more officers and men linked arms
and, forming one long line of white coats and
caps, blue breeches and black boots, went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>through the mystic mazes of the national
Servian dance with much precision, no little
amount of gusto and a great deal of effervescent
enthusiasm. As I witnessed this “Kola” it was nothing if
not an inspiring sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> very early history of Servia and her
peoples has been daubed so freely with myth
and fable that it would be confusing and
tedious to enter into it. Instead, I shall confine
myself to the brief narration of the two
later dynasties, explanatory of the world-renowned
friction between them.</p>

<p>Of all the capitals of the world none deserves
more unquestionably the sobriquet of
“The Capital of Crime,” as I have named a
later chapter, than that of Servia. Since the
beginning of the nineteenth century four
reigning monarchs have been ruthlessly murdered
in or near Belgrade, and four others
have been forced to abdicate. What would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>have been the fate of these latter had they not
foreseen it can readily be imagined. King-killing
is chronic with the Servians and there
are to-day twenty-nine men incarcerated in
the prison at Belgrade, charged with plotting
against the life of the present ruler, King
Peter Karageorgevitch.</p>

<p>The history of these national tragedies, the
latest of which, in 1903, shocked the civilized
world, begins with the histories of the two
royal families of Servia, and takes us back
a hundred years, to a time when the country
was suffering the most from the perennial
invasions of the bloodthirsty Mohammedans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“The end of the year 1801 saw Servia a
prey to systematized vandalism. It was a
reign of unexampled tyranny and cruelty.
The bloodthirstiness of the Sultan’s janizaries
increased like the strength of a torrent. The
Dahis, in obedience to the Sultan’s firmans,
commissioned murderers to proceed through
Servia and kill all the mayors of towns and
villages, chiefs of cantons, priests and monks.
A wave of terror swept over the land, spreading
panic in every direction. Mothers hugged
their children to their breasts and men in
hushed whispers spoke of self-destruction as
a less miserable fate than falling into the
hands of the Turks. Every male over seven
years of age was to be destroyed. But something
in the Servians which had hitherto lain
dormant, a spirit of manhood which had not
been manifested before, arose under the whip
of the gigantic thraldom; seemingly the
crushed and oppressed drew breath, the instinct
of self-preservation kindled in their
hearts, and the embers burst out into a new
flame of patriotism.”</p>

<p>Such, then, happened to be the deplorable
conditions in Servia when George Petrovich,
or Kara-George, a poverty-stricken peasant
of a fiery temperament, but a man of dominating
energy, morose and taciturn, imbued with
this patriotic flame, descended from the little
village of Topola where he made his home.
By means of his character and personal magnetism
he rallied his countrymen and posted
the now-famed proclamation, which called
upon the whole of Servia to rise against the
Turks. The latter were driven from the
country after a siege of eight days, and for
nine years Karageorge ruled in Servia and
kept at bay the subjects of the Sultan.</p>

<p>But in 1813, the Turks, encouraged by the
jealousy which had been impregnated in the
hearts of the military chiefs on account of the
pre-eminence of Karageorge, proclaimed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>holy war. In vain did the peasant leader appeal
to his people to withstand the attacks of
the Mohammedans and, in the end, he fled
disgusted to his mountain home.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the Servians found
a new champion in Milosh Obrenovitch, General
of Rudneek under Karageorge, and,
after a successful campaign against the Turks,
he was proclaimed a hero.</p>

<p>Karageorge, off among the hills, was loth
to see this Milosh taking his place in the hearts
of his people, so, in 1817, disregarding utterly
the orders of the Vizir and the advices of
Milosh himself, he decided to return to his
subjects. He stopped for the night at the
house of Semendria Vouitza, who, oblivious
to the old ties of friendship and his duties as a
host, murdered his guest as he slept, and who
knows but at the instigation of Milosh Obrenovitch?</p>

<p>This, then, was the first of the Servian royal
tragedies, and the beginning of the deep and
terrible feud between the families of Karageorge
and Obrenovitch, the latest victims of
which were the unfortunate and weakly King
Alexander, the last Obrenovitch, and his
queen, Draga, in 1903.</p>

<p>In 1830 Turkey permitted Milosh to assume
the title of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>“Prince Milosh Obrenovitch I.”
By this action she yielded to Servia’s
demands, for Turkey had suffered defeat
in the hands of the Russians in 1829, and
Russia was literally the sponsor of Servia.
But in 1839 the broil between the old adherents
of Karageorge and the followers of his
successor, far worse than mere family jealousies,
because it divided a nation, caused
the abdication of Prince Milosh in favour
of his elder son, Prince Milan, who held
the reins of government but a few short
weeks when he died and his brother, Prince
Michael, assumed the leadership of the Servians.</p>

<p>Only three years later Prince Michael was
compelled to resign and Alexander, son of
Karageorge, was elected in his stead. The
year 1859 witnessed the enforced resignation
of Alexander and the re-instalment of old
Prince Milosh Obrenovitch, who had answered
the fickle summons to return to his people.
He died the following year, and Prince
Michael was, for the second time, made the
reigning head of Servia.</p>

<p>The fact that Michael’s wife, who was Princess
Julia, a descendant of a royal Hungarian
family and maid of honour to the Empress of
Austria, was childless gave rise to the dastardly
Karageorgevitch plot to put an end to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>the Obrenovitch dynasty by the murder of her
husband. Milosh Obrenovitch, junior, so to
speak, a grand-nephew of Prince Michael, was
the only heir to the Servian throne and the
would-be regicides were confident that a new
constitution might be proclaimed in favour of
Peter Karageorgevitch, the present ruler and
a grandson of the peasant, Black George.
The sooner this should be attempted the better,
for was not Prince Michael even then contemplating
the divorce of his wife, in order
that he might marry Katrine Constantinovitch,
his cousin, and so insure an heir to the
throne in the birth of a son?</p>

<p>June 10, 1868, was the day set for the
tragedy.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the Prince’s custom
of driving unattended by military escort
through the deer park at Topchidere, four
men, all criminals with notorious careers, met
him along the road as he drove in his carriage
with Katrine Constantinovitch and two other
relatives. As the Prince’s carriage advanced,
these four men stepped to one side and bared
their heads in recognition of his Royal Highness.
Hardly had he passed when they fired
simultaneously upon the royal party, killing
the Prince almost instantly and mortally
wounding Mlle. Constantinovitch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>Owing to a mishap to the carriage of the
conniving news-bearer the true tale of the
tragedy reached Belgrade before him and it
was only through the masterful diplomacy of
M. Petrovitch Blasnavatz, the Minister of
War, that the throne of Servia was saved for
the young Milan Obrenovitch.</p>

<p>In 1872 Prince Milan reached his majority
and three years later, in Vienna, fell in love
with the beautiful, charming Roumanian princess,
Natalie, who was destined to play such
a prominent role in the future of the Servian
nation. To their union was born a son, Prince
Alexander, “Little Sasha,” as the Servians
lovingly called him. Natalie was popular
with her subjects, and in many ways their love
for her was made manifest. On one occasion,
when she lay confined in her apartments before
the birth of Alexander, the people walked
along the street in front of the palace on tiptoe
and spoke only in whispers, so fearful
were they of disturbing her quiet.</p>

<p>But Milan, although a devoted parent and
an unimpeachable patriot and ruler, proved
himself nothing less than a Machiavellian roué.
The persistent outcries against his dual life
gained Natalie a divorce, which was subsequently
revoked on account of her refusal to
leave the country. Then, because of the continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
murmurs of the Karageorgevitch faction
against him, Milan abdicated and bade
farewell to the “Little Sasha” on March 6,
1889. He died later in Vienna financially,
physically and morally bankrupt.</p>

up her home in Biarritz in a chateau which she
had previously purchased; while back in Belgrade,
Alexander, under the guidance of regents,
had taken upon himself the burdens of
a nominal ruler of Servia. It was not long,
however, before the want of the devoted affection
and the healthful moral influence of his
mother began to produce their effects. In
many ways Alexander endeavoured to emulate
his father. Although headstrong in the
extreme, even to stubbornness, he became pitiably
vulnerable, under the tutelage of less
scrupulous associates, to influences not altogether
conducive to his popularity as a king.</p>

<p>It was to his indiscretion and contumacious
perversity that was accredited one of the most
horrible royal tragedies in the history of the
world. In fact, it was on one of Alexander’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>imprudent escapades that he met Draga Maschine,
then lady-in-waiting to his mother and
the adventuresome widow of an engineer in
the Servian army. An illicit union with this
woman kindled the spark of love between
them, which ignited, as time wore on and the
number of their meetings increased, into the
burning flame of passionate devotion.</p>

<p>Of the women of Belgrade, Draga Maschine,
at the time of her ascendency, was an
acknowledged star in point of beauty of face
and figure. She was tall and graceful in bearing;
her eyes were dark and lustrous; her
hair was said to have been black like the hue
of a raven; the curves of her mouth were bewitching;
the type of her chin was indicative
of determined character. Beyond these attributes
she was vivacious and alluring. While
yet a mere girl of seventeen she had been married
to a young army engineer, but even at
that tender age she had had the reputation
of being a maid of uncertain morals, and her
marriage failed to act as a curb to her perverted
desires and inclinations. She had been
wedded barely a year when her husband took
his own life because of her alleged disregard
for the holy bonds of matrimony. It was then
that Colonel Maschine, her brother-in-law and
her enemy from the first, plotter against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>King and the man destined to act the role of
arch-murderer in the final scene of the greatest
of Servian tragedies, swore he would have
retribution for her conduct, which, he said, had
been the cause of his brother’s suicide.</p>

<p>In due course of time Draga became fired
with the hope of future social distinction. She
had been dragged through the mire of ill-repute
and was now determined to attain the
coveted recognition of society, not as an adventuress,
but as a lady of wealth and rank.
To this end she even sought the influence in
her behalf of a minister of the Servian court,
and through him the unsophisticated Natalie
resolved to help her, pensioned her, and finally
made Draga one of her ladies-in-waiting at
Biarritz.</p>

<p>In 1898 the young King Alexander, upon
a visit to his mother at Biarritz, met Draga,
his future queen and for whom he felt no little
affection from the first.</p>

<p>Natalie, during this visit of her son, laid
before him her plans for his marriage to Princess
Lilly Mirko of Montenegro, his cousin,
an Obrenovitch descendant and one of the
most beautiful women in all Europe. But the
King, already having been subjected by the
subtle charms of Draga (who, by her beauty
and manners, had established herself as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>most fascinating of Natalie’s attendants), disappointed
his mother by taking no thought
of her proposal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Draga Maschine left
not a single stone unturned to win the love
of the young King. Their secret meetings
were the gossip of the community. Finally,
Natalie became alarmed at the mutual infatuation
of her son and her superlatively captivating
lady-in-waiting and dismissed the latter
from her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</i>. But this action seemed
only to weld more securely the relations of
the pair, for Draga returned triumphantly to
Belgrade and the scenes of her early degradation
as none other than the mistress of the
King himself.</p>

<p>This marks the date when the power of
Draga over Alexander was brought to bear
in earnest. It was at her instigation that the
King, upon attaining his majority, locked his
regents in a room of the palace after having
invited them to dinner, drew his revolver,
boastingly declared himself the all-powerful
King of the Serbs and issued an order that his
father, Prince Milan, then living humbly in
Vienna, should be shot the moment he might
attempt to cross the Servian frontier.</p>

<p>Then Russia, always partial to the Karageorgevitch
dynasty, and prime promoter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>the political intrigues of Servia for her own
aggrandizement, foresaw a possible end of the
Obrenovitch dynasty and, by the leverage of
the King’s love for his mistress, proceeded
forthwith with skill and subterfuge to pave
the way for a Karageorgevitch ruler.</p>

<p>Anticipating the final outcome of the possible
marriage of Alexander and Draga, Russia
commissioned the wife of a Cossack colonel
as an agent to use her influence to bring about
such a union. Accordingly, this woman became
a personal friend of Draga; she interested
herself in Draga’s love affair and, at
an opportune moment, broached to her the
subject of marriage with the King. Draga
protested on the ground that they loved each
other and were already very happy, but the
exalted position of a Queen of Servia was so
incessantly brought to her mind that she
finally acquiesced to the suggestions of her
supposedly friendly adviser. The King was
assured that Russia would recognize the marriage,
for the Great White Czar himself consented
to act as best man, and the day for the
wedding was set.</p>

<p>What must have been the thoughts of Alexander
as he drove that day through the decorated
streets of Belgrade? Was he so wrapt
up in his love for the aspiring Draga that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>had failed to discover the plots against him?
Or, aware of the deep-rooted intrigue to further
the ends of a selfish monarchy, did he
stubbornly face disaster and ultimate death
in his loyalty to his Queen?</p>

<p>As the royal couple returned to the <em>konak</em>
from the cathedral, after the marriage ceremony,
the streets were thronged with a staring,
phlegmatic crowd, which looked upon its
new Queen in silence and wonder. Not a
cheer was raised; not a trumpet sounded. All
marvelled, and stood aghast at the thought
that so strange and incongruous a union had
received the sanction of the church.</p>

<p>Because of the marriage of Draga to the
King the ire of her enemies had been expanded
to the highest power. The net of
conspiracy continued to be woven more tightly
about her and her faithful but foolish husband.
When she learned that it was a physical impossibility
for her to become a mother she
schemed to pass off an alien child as a legitimate
heir to the throne; but the Czar of Russia,
who had been asked to act as god-father
to the child, and who, at the same time, seriously
doubted the motherhood of Draga, sent
his court physician to Belgrade to investigate.
So frantic became the new Queen’s desire to
give birth to a son that, in her dilemma, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>made use of her irresistible power to induce
Alexander to proclaim her own brother, Nikodim
Lunyevitza, as heir apparent; this Alexander
did, disregarding utterly the entreaties
and expostulations of the Ministry.</p>

<p>His action galled the Servians beyond endurance,
and immediately plans were set on
foot to dispose of the Queen, and the King
also, should he persist in the validity of his
proclamation. It is said that a woman was
sent to Geneva to propose to Peter Karageorgevitch
that he come to Belgrade and be
proclaimed King by the army, it being understood
that he accept the liberal constitution
previously annulled by Alexander.</p>

<p>Everything now pointed to the murder of
the King and Queen, but the former, although
warned by word and by letter many times,
seemed oblivious to all danger. He went so
far as to augment the bitter feeling by issuing
an order transferring a number of officers,
who were known to have conspired against
him, to garrisons in the interior of the country.
All Servia was aware that a royal tragedy
was pending. Even Draga realized it for, on
the very day before her assassination, she
wrote pathetically in a letter to a friend: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>“I
am haunted by a dreadful presentiment, and
often at night I seem to see a terrifying picture
of Michael<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in his death agony, stretching
his blood-stained hand toward his murderers
and crying, ‘Stop! My brothers! It is
enough!’”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Undoubtedly Prince Michael is meant, Alexander’s great-grand-uncle,
an account of whose murder in Topchidere Park in
1868 has been given in a previous chapter.</p></div>

<p class="hang50">Plans of Procedure&mdash;Meeting of the Regicides&mdash;The First
Move&mdash;The Murder of the King and Queen&mdash;The Assassination
of Others&mdash;The Royal Burial&mdash;The Murder of the
Brothers Novakovics in 1907.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Swiftly</span> and silently had been fomented
the plot of wholesale slaughter, of which the
Queen was marked as the first and chief victim.
If the King could be induced to sign
a form of abdication he was to be given a
chance for his life; his refusal meant death.
The murderers&mdash;and of these there were
almost a hundred who cut and slashed at the
lifeless bodies of their sovereign&mdash;would
then descend upon the house of the Queen’s
relatives and kill all in cold blood. This was
to be followed by the assassination of the
King’s adherents, including General Zinzar
Markowitz, the Prime Minister; General
Pawlowitch, the Minister of War; M. Todorowitch,
Minister of the Interior; and
many officers of the army who had refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>to join, or who had expressed themselves as
being opposed to the plot to kill the royal
couple.</p>

<p>The red glow of the setting sun had scarcely
faded from the sky behind the walls and turrets
of the old fortress on Wednesday evening,
June 10, 1903, when the regicides gathered at
the “Crown Café” to discuss and perfect
their plans for the invasion of the palace that
night. They sat about smoking and laughing
and drinking until many were in a state of
intoxication. The scene was one common in
Belgrade. You will see just such a company
of officers grouped about the tables along
the street in front of any restaurant in the
Servian capital of a summer evening. Perhaps,
if you will notice, some of these men
wear upon the breast, amid an array of other
medals, a small, white Maltese cross. You
may be sure that the proud possessors of these
crosses were implicated in the terrible plot of
that June evening&mdash;mayhap, some whom
you will see are the very ones who, frenzied
by the sting of liquor, broke open the door
to the royal bedchamber and fired mercilessly
upon the helpless occupants. The white
crosses are decorations pinned on the breasts
of those who helped to do away with Alexander
and Draga by King Peter himself, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> apparent
grateful recognition of their services.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_063"><img src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="359" /></a>
<p class="caption">A SIDEWALK CAFÉ, BELGRADE.</p>
</div>

<p>During this preliminary meeting of the
regicides at the café it was announced that
everything had been arranged satisfactorily:
the co-operation of the servants and soldiers,
within the palace and without, was assured by
none other than Colonel Maschine, the brother-in-law
of the Queen, who personally had made
arrangements to thus afford the least possible
difficulty in entering the <em>konak</em>; the doors of
the palace would even be left unlocked; a
regiment of soldiers had been commissioned
to cover the rear of the conspirators and repel
any attack.</p>

<p>By midnight all details had been completed,
and the truculent corps of more or less intoxicated
officers moved stealthily toward the palace
gates. After overwhelming a suspiciously
weak and pitiful resistance on the part of the
guards they tramped across the garden and
lawn, burst through the unlocked doors of the
<em>konak</em> and scrambled pell-mell up the broad
stairs in search of the royal apartments. An
officer encountered in the hallway was killed
instantly, and a private who offered some
slight resistance suffered a like fate. General
Petrowitch, loaded revolver in hand, was the
next victim, although he endeavoured to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the exact whereabouts of the royal couple
by leading the crowd to another part of the
palace.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the King and Queen were
awakened by the shots on the stairs and the
loud curses of the frantic criminals. How
they endeavoured to conceal themselves in
their helplessness must have been pathetic indeed.
Hurrying from their bed, and still
clothed in night attire, they secreted themselves
in an adjoining closet which was used
as a wardrobe-room by Queen Draga. Here
they crouched together, trembling in prayer,
while their conspirators raged through room
after room, demolishing <em>bric-à-brac</em>, overturning
tables and chairs, tearing pictures from
the walls and looting the palace from top to
bottom.</p>

<p>Through a window in this closet the luckless
King and Queen saw, by the dim, flickering
light of the street lamps, a great crowd
collect outside the palace gates. They were
unable to comprehend why this crowd stood
motionless and silent&mdash;why they did not rise
up, like the devoted and loyal subjects they
were supposed to be, and offer assistance.</p>

<p>At seven minutes past two a stick of dynamite
was applied to the door of the bedchamber,
the explosion of which burst the barrier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>to atoms and stopped a clock which stood upon
a mantel in the room. One report has it that
the Queen, thinking the officers had departed,
owing to a sudden lull in the noise in the bedchamber,
foolishly raised the window in the
closet and cried to the crowd outside in the
street, “You will save your King and Queen.”</p>

<p>This action is said to have disclosed to the
men the hiding-place of their victims. At all
events the latter were discovered cowering in
a corner of the closet, praying and pleading
for mercy. The Queen was fired upon and
killed instantly, and the King, in trying to
shield her, fell a victim to the volley of shots
hardly a moment later. Not to shrink from
fulfilling an oath previously taken by many
of the officers, that each would bury the point
of his sword in the corpse of the Queen, they
mutilated and hacked the bodies beyond recognition.
It was found later that the body
of Queen Draga bore no less than fifty-seven
sword wounds.</p>

<p>And then, as a fitting sequel to their ghastly
proceedings, the regicides tossed the bodies
from the window of the closet where the King
and Queen had stood but a few moments before
and looked out upon the crowd. They
fell with a thud into the garden below, where
they remained until ten o’clock the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>day, all the while being viewed apathetically
by the passing and repassing throng of people.
At that late hour, Russia, whose embassy
was directly across the street from the <em>konak</em>,
to cover as much as possible the part she had
played in the tragedy, in the person of her
minister demanded that the bodies be removed.</p>

<p>Leaving the palace and the carnage they
had wrought there, the regicides, led by Colonel
Maschine, sought the home of the Queen’s
family and succeeded in killing her two brothers,
Nikola and Nikodim. The Minister of
War suffered the same fate in his home and
the Minister of the Interior was severely
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

killed, but I have the best of authority for contesting that point.
He was thrown into prison and has only lately been released.

<p class="caption">KING PETER KARAGEORGEVITCH OF SERVIA.</p>
</div>

<p>About this time Colonel Nikolics, the commandant
of the Danube Division of the army,
who, with a regiment of infantry, was in quarters
outside the city, heard of what was going
on in Belgrade. In a heroic attempt to bring
his troops to the palace gates, with the hope
of saving his sovereigns, he was met at the
edge of the town by a revolutionary regiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>under the command of Colonel Gagowitch.
Both officers were killed in the hand-to-hand
encounter which followed.</p>

<p>The bloody labour of this night was at last
terminated by the murder of many officers of
the army, who had been branded by the revolutionaries
with the hot iron of revenge for
being in league with the King.</p>

<p>The morning of June eleventh dawned gray
and dismal. The very heavens seemed mortified
at the awful butchery of the night before.
Rain descended in torrents, while crowds of
indifferent Servians paced to and fro in front
of the palace. The city was in the hands of
the revolutionaries.</p>

<p>There is no need to go into political details
of the aftermath: suffice it to say that Peter
Karageorgevitch was elected King by the
Parliament and notified to leave Geneva for
Belgrade at once. The family feud of a hundred
years had been brought to an awful termination,
since Alexander, having no heir,
was the last descendant of Milosh Obrenovitch.</p>

<p>Under cover of the blackness of the night
of Friday, June twelfth, two roughly hewn
coffins were carried into the <em>konak</em>, and in them
were placed the mutilated remains of Alexander
and Draga. No care whatever was
even taken to clothe the bodies properly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>While the people of Belgrade still slept and
dreamed of the events of to-morrow the hearse
was driven, slowly, out through the rear gate
of the palace grounds, over the cobbled streets,
up to the weather-beaten door of the little
chapel of the Obrenovitch family, which
stands in the old cemetery of St. Mark, back
of the city. Graves had been prepared hurriedly
under the board floor of the chapel and,
after chanted benedictions had been uttered by
two priests&mdash;the only mourners&mdash;the bodies
of the chief victims of the bloodiest national
tragedy of modern times were lowered reverently
to their final resting-place.</p>

<p>Story has it that the rambler roses, which
cover thickly the fence in front of the palace
grounds, had bloomed white until the summer
of 1903, but that the spilled blood of the royal
couple had changed their hue to red. Of
course this is a consoling little piece of fiction,
circulated by the friends of the Obrenovitch
dynasty; but one thing is agreed upon by all,
that the roses never bloomed in such profusion
or with such gorgeous colouring as they did
that year.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BALL-ROOM OF THE NEW PALACE, BELGRADE.</p>
</div>

<p>While strolling by the palace grounds to-day
you would scarcely believe that only a few
years ago the <em>konak</em> of Alexander and Draga
stood upon the very spot where now a bandstand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
festooned with electric bulbs, shelters
the musicians as they play for the royal family,
while the street in front hums with the
chatter of gay promenaders. You will see the
same red rambler roses, forming a brilliant
screen to the beautiful garden in the background.
Perhaps you can, through the eye
of your imagination, see the very spot upon
which fell the distorted remains of royalty on
that memorable tenth of June.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the untimely
death of the last Obrenovitch put an end to
the family contentions, a number of dastardly
crimes are perpetrated each year in Belgrade
by the constituents of the two rival houses.
The latest Servian outrage to be hawked before
the world was the murder in prison of the
brothers Novakovics on September 28, 1907,
because of their too zealous efforts to bring
to the bar of Justice the real murderers of
King Alexander.</p>

<p>Captain Novakovics, a short time after the
murder of the late King and Queen, was the
instigator of a wide-spread scheme to bring
the regicides to trial. This scheme was betrayed,
Novakovics was tried by court martial
and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment,
during which period two unsuccessful attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to poison him were made. Upon his
release, although his health was permanently
shaken, he started a daily paper called “Za
Otadjbinu,” in the columns of which he attacked
the present ruling dynasty and, in more
or less open language, accused King Peter,
unflinchingly, of being the prime mover of
the plot to do away with Alexander. His
printing presses were seized and he was arrested
the second time, the absurd charge having
been brought against him that he had
stolen three screws from his own machine
which, a few hours before, had been sold at
auction by the police. Twenty-five days of
incarceration in an under-ground dungeon
with many of the worst criminals in the land
failed to break his spirit, and he&mdash;with his
brother, who had also been arrested and sent
to prison&mdash;was transferred to a cell which
overlooked the street. Again bribes and
threats failed to insure his future silence.</p>

<p>Finally, the two brothers, unable longer to
withstand the assaults made upon them by the
prison-keepers, decided to call public attention
to their case. Having secured, during a
moment of relaxation on the part of the
guards, rifles from a near-by room, they barricaded
the door to their cell quickly and commenced
firing toward the ceiling. The police,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>failing in courage to burst open the door, resorted
to a heinous method of overpowering
the prisoners, which was invented on the moment
by a reinstated detective agent. A solution
of saltpetre was inserted through the window
of the cell. Gradually the rifle-firing
ceased, the door was broken open and, although
the prisoners lay senseless upon the
floor, the enraged jailers riddled their bodies
with bullets.</p>

<p>People, who had gathered outside attracted
by the shots of the prisoners, cried, “Asphyxiates
were forbidden at The Hague!” “Down
with the police!” “Enough of regicide rule!”
But the prison was soon surrounded with cavalry
troops and the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p>Captain Novakovics was a scion of one of
the best Servian families, and had been married
but four months before his assassination.
His body was not only forbidden to be placed
in the family vault, but his relatives were not
even allowed to attend his funeral.</p>

<p class="hang50">Prediction of the Assassination of Prince Michael&mdash;Natalie’s
Visit to the Parisian Fortune-teller&mdash;The Prediction in
London of the Murder of Draga and Alexander.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Strange</span> and mysterious as it may seem, the
occult, the supernatural, has played no small
part in the destiny of Servian affairs. Personally,
I am not of clairvoyant proclivities,
I know nothing whatever of the goings-on
at spiritualistic <em>seances</em>, neither am I even
slightly versed in anything that pertains to
psychical research, but in this chapter I am
compelled to give credence to the cabalistic
power displayed by three persons, two women
and one man, in their wonderful predictions
of three separate and distinct turning points
in the life of the Servian nation.</p>

<p>The first of these was the prognostication
of the fate of Prince Michael, the second was
that of the social ascendency of Draga, and
the third, that of the horrible death of Queen
Draga and her husband&mdash;this latter foretold
in a foreign city, almost three months before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>the tragedy really occurred, by one who had
neither seen nor had had any connection whatever
with the King and Queen of Servia.</p>

<p>On the morning of the very day of the assassination
of Prince Michael Obrenovitch in
Topchidere Park, a poor peasant of Cremna,
of local distinction because of his occult powers
of divination but unknown outside of his immediate
community, tore through the mountains
like a madman, beating his breasts with
his fists and crying, “Our Prince is dead!
They have murdered our Prince!”</p>

<p>The cry was taken up by all with whom he
came in contact, repeated broadcast and, in
an incredibly short space of time, it was upon
the lips of every one in Belgrade.</p>

<p>The peasant of Cremna was seized and
thrown into prison, charged with being a fanatical
disturber, but hardly before the verification
of the tragedy had reached the capital.</p>

<p>The facts of this case are now preserved in
the minutes of the national assembly.</p>

<p>The second instance of occultism occurred
in 1897 while Draga was in the service of
Queen Natalie, the year before she met her
future husband.</p>

<p>Natalie had laughingly suggested to Draga and Mademoiselle Tzanka,
another member of the Queen’s coterie, that they accompany <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>her on
a visit to a certain mind-reader and spiritualistic medium of wide
reputation in Paris. The trio called upon this supernaturally-endowed
person, Madame de Thebes by name, and Natalie requested that the future
be read for her son, the young Alexander, and for her friends. To her
the Parisian fortune-teller replied, “Madame, you nourish in your bosom
a viper which will turn and sting you”; evidently meaning Draga. She
continued that the marriage of the young King
would determine the whole future of Servia.</p>

<p>Some inept futurity was predicted for
Mademoiselle Tzanka, but to Draga the
woman said: “You, Madame, will rise to a
higher position than you even imagined. One
day you will even reign a queen; but when
that day dawns your life will be in danger,
and you will drag your lover and your husband
to his ruin and his death.”</p>

<p>This story was published eventually in the
newspapers and, three years after Draga’s
ascent to the throne was prophesied, she denied
vehemently that such had ever been predicted,
but in the same breath she denounced
Mademoiselle Tzanka scurrilously for having
dared to repeat what had taken place in
Paris.</p>

<p>In describing the <em>seance</em> at which the
prediction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> was made of the murder of Alexander
and Draga I can do no better than to take,
verbatim, in part or as a whole, the statements
of Mr. William Stead, editor of the <cite>Review
of Reviews</cite>, who was the host on that occasion,
and of his Excellency, M. Mijatovich, at
that time Servian Minister at the Court of
St. James and a distinguished diplomat.
These signed statements were made to the
press by Mr. Stead and others who were present,
and relate what actually took place at the
<em>seance</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Mr. Stead’s Statement</em></p>

<p>“I had invited a numerous company, including
M. Mijatovich, Earl Grey, Mr.
L&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. Gilbert Elliot, etc., to come on
Friday, March 20th, 1903, to witness an experiment
in psychometry by Mrs. Burchell at
our weekly ‘at home’ in Mowbray House.</p>

<p>“The ‘at home’ at Mowbray House began
at four in the afternoon. The psychometric
experiment began an hour later, in the presence
of seventy or eighty persons. In about
half an hour it was seen that the conditions
were adverse, and Mrs. Burchell went upstairs
to give private sittings, where she succeeded
much better, while the company remained below
and discussed psychometry. This went on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>till after seven.... About eight we went to
the restaurant of Gatti and Rodesano, Strand
... I sat at the head of the table, with Mrs.
Burchell on my right and Mrs. Manks on my
left. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; sat at the opposite end of
the table, next to my private secretary, on
the other side of Mrs. Burchell....</p>

<p>“During the dinner the conversation was
general. We talked at my end of the table
about many things, and as Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; was
present, I talked about him and about Servia.
But as far as I can remember the name of the
King was never mentioned, nor was anything
said that directly or indirectly could suggest
the idea of his assassination. No such thought
was present to my mind. As for Mrs. Burchell,
she is a plain North Country woman,
who dispenses medicine of her own making,
who has had a family of ten children and who
did not seem to me a person who had either
interest in, or knowledge of, the Balkan Peninsula.
She has since, in the <cite>St. James Gazette</cite>,
written: ‘As to my knowledge of Servian
affairs, I was then completely ignorant,
and did not know either the King’s name or
the Queen’s antecedents or name, or anything
in connection with them in any way.’ She
was tired and silent at dinner, depressed by
the consciousness of the afternoon failure at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>psychometry, and I addressed most of my remarks
to Mrs. Manks.</p>

<p>“After the dinner there were several descriptions
given by Mrs. Burchell of the impressions
which she had received in connection
with various members of the company. It
was in her descriptions of the impressions she
had received from Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; that he nodded
from time to time; an indiscretion which led
to a protest from my private secretary. This,
however, had nothing to do with the vision of
the assassination. When the prediction was
made Mrs. Burchell had her eyes closed. I
had no idea, while she was speaking, whether
she was describing a tragedy that had taken
place long ago or was predicting what would
happen. I did not know what was in the envelope
which she placed to her brow until
after all was over. When the paper was
taken out of the envelope, not being able to
decipher the Cyrillic characters, I asked Mr.
L&mdash;&mdash; whose name it was. He replied, ‘The
King.’He then entered into conversation
with Mrs. Burchell, but I did not hear what
she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“The other two clairvoyants present, Mrs.
Brenchley and Mrs. Manks, declared that they
saw the same scene when it was in progress,
and Mrs. Brenchley was only one degree less
excited than Mrs. Burchell. It was she who
added the detail about the Russian uniforms.”</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Statement of M. Mijatovich</em></p>

<p>“I, Chedomille Mijatovich, now residing
at 51, Palace Gardens Terrace, Kensington,
make this statement, as being, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, a full and exact narrative
of what I know of this remarkable affair.</p>

<p>“I have long taken a deep interest in psychical
research, and this brought me, five or
six years ago, to make the acquaintance of
Mr. Stead, the editor of <em>Borderland</em> and <cite>The
Review of Reviews</cite>. Knowing my interest in
these subjects, Mr. Stead invited me to be
present at a meeting in his office in Mowbray
House, Norfolk Street, London, on Friday
afternoon, March 20, 1903, when a psychometrist
of some repute was to give a demonstration
of her capacity to receive impressions
from articles held in her hand, of the origin
and nature of which she had no information.
The following is an extract from Mr. Stead’s
letter:</p>

<p>“‘On Friday next at our “at home” we
shall have a very good clairvoyant at Mowbray
House. She has undertaken to do from
twelve to twenty tests. That is to say, ten or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>twenty articles will be submitted to her at
random, of all of which she will know nothing,
and she will state what she sees in connection
with each. I hope that you will be able to
come and to bring with you one or two articles,
the clairvoyant reading of which might be of
interest or value....’</p>

<p>“I accepted the invitation. The rooms at
Mowbray House were crowded. The lady,
whose name I was told was Mrs. Burchell,
complained that the conditions were bad, and
the experiment was a failure.</p>

<p>“Among the articles brought to Mowbray
House for submission to the psychometrist
was the signature of King Alexander. The
name was signed in Cyrillic characters on a
sheet of paper which was enclosed in an envelope.
It was prepared in order to see
whether the psychometrist, from handling the
envelope, could ‘sense’ and describe the person
of the King. That was the sole object of
the experiment. Nothing more was claimed
or expected.</p>

<p>“Owing to the number of articles offered
for experiment, and owing also to the abrupt
termination of the trials, the envelope with the
King’s signature was not produced....
While I was present nothing was said as to
its existence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>“When I quitted Mowbray House the
King’s signature was left with one of the company,
Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, who remained behind to
dine with Mr. Stead, Mrs. Burchell and some
others. I was unable to stay to dinner as I
had to go to the Court at Buckingham Palace
that evening. I returned home feeling that
the experiment had been a failure.</p>

<p>“On the following morning ... I was surprised
to receive a visit at my house ... from
Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. He said that after the dinner in
the restaurant a <em>seance</em> had been held, at
which he had submitted the envelope, containing
the King’s signature, to Mrs. Burchell.
He told me that on receiving the envelope she
had been thrown into a state of violent agitation.
She had then described the assassination
of the King and the attempted assassination
of the Queen in the interior of the palace. He
gave me many details which had convinced
him that Mrs. Burchell had actually seen in
clairvoyant vision the assassination of my
Sovereign in the interior of his palace.</p>

<p>“On the following Tuesday, March 24th, I
made it my business to call at Mowbray
House in order to ascertain from Mr. Stead
his version of what had happened.... On
returning home I made an entry in my journal,
of which the following is an exact copy:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“‘<span class="smcap">London (51, Palace Gardens Terrace)</span>,</p>
<p class="center">“‘<span class="smcap">March 24, 1903.</span></p>

<p>“‘This afternoon I went to Mowbray
House, Norfolk Street, Victoria Embankment,
to see Mr. William Stead (the editor
of <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>), and to ask him what
it was that his clairvoyant of last Friday
(March 20th) said of King Alexander. Mr.
Stead told me.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; gave her into her hand a
small paper. She held it for a moment and
then said: “This is the signature of a young
man in a very high position! Yes, it is the
signature of a King!” (She then proceeded
to describe King Alexander’s appearance).
“He has his Queen at his side; she is a brunette,
older than he. But, O God! What do
I see? Oh, it is too terrible....” And then,
Mr. Stead said, she suddenly fell on her
knees, clasping excitedly her hands, and with
closed eyes and uplifted head she prayed to
the Great Spirit to&mdash;save them, if possible!
“I see them both, the King and Queen; and
there is a dark man with the dagger in hand.
He tries to kill them; it is a terrible struggle;
the Queen escapes unhurt, but the King is
assassinated!” Stead said Mrs. Bourcher
(sic), the clairvoyant, was terribly agitated.
She described what she saw in the presence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>several ladies and gentlemen, who were deeply
impressed with it.’</p></div>

<p>“Four days later, on March 28th, I wrote a letter to King Alexander,
in the course of which I felt it my duty to warn him as to impending
danger. I did not keep a copy of my letter, but I perfectly well
remember the passage in question.... I wrote as follows:</p>

<p>“‘I know your Majesty will laugh, as you
usually laughed when I spoke to you about
clairvoyance, so I am not going to give you
all particulars about the latest experience
which I have had, but I implore your Majesty
to take all possible measures for your personal
safety, not only when you drive about or when
you go to the church or the theatre or to the
park, but when in your palace especially, because
I have reason to believe that an attempt
will be made to assassinate you in your own
palace.’</p>

<p>“My wife read my letter before it was sent
off and she confirms the accuracy of this account
of its contents. I may say that I had
often talked to King Alexander about psychic
experiences, but he always mocked me and
would not take them seriously. I never before
sent him any warning as to an attempt
on his person.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>“I was myself so deeply impressed by the
importance of the clairvoyant’s vision that I
half expected that the King, despite his skepticism,
would summon me to Belgrade in order
to hear more details. This expectation was
not realized. He neither sent for me nor took
any notice of my warning.</p>

<p>“When the news arrived of his tragic end,
my thoughts instantly recurred to the warning
which I had sent him, and I stated to
several representatives of the press the fact,
which was duly published in the London evening
newspapers of June 11th.”</p>


<p><em>What Actually Took Place at the Seance</em></p>

<p>“It was after ten o’clock at the restaurant
when Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; thrust an envelope into Mr.
Stead’s hand, saying, ‘Try her with that!’
Mr. Stead took the envelope, not knowing
what it contained, and waited till the good
lady had finished a description to the last of
the sitters. She was getting tired and wished
to go home. Mr. Stead put the envelope in
her hands and asked her to try once more and
see if she could get anything with it.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Burchell took the envelope in her
two hands and sat for a moment, still. She
turned the envelope round and round once or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>twice and then said, in a loud, clear voice,
‘Royalty! An important person&mdash;a King!’</p>

<p>“The announcement riveted attention and
we listened eagerly for what was to follow.
Mrs. Burchell spoke with extreme rapidity
and in breathless excitement. There was nothing
to indicate that the medium was in a
trance. She had been talking quite normally
just before Mr. Stead gave her the envelope.
Her eyes were closed, but this might have
been done to aid in abstracting her from her
surroundings. She spoke exactly as if she
were looking through a window into an interior
and describing what she saw to us who
were beside her. Near to her were two other
clairvoyants, Mrs. Brenchley and Mrs.
Manks.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Burchell began by saying, ‘Royalty!
An important person&mdash;a King! He is standing
in a room in his palace. He is dark; stout
body and long neck. With him is a lady, the
Queen&mdash;brunette. And there,’pointing to a
corner of the room, ‘I see a child.’ Then,
becoming very excited, the medium exclaimed,
‘Terrible! Terrible! It is all bloody. I cannot
bear to look. Oh, it is terrible! I cannot
bear it. I see a very dark man rushing into
the chamber. He tries to kill the King. The
lady implores them to spare him. Oh&mdash;’ and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>with a cry of horror Mrs. Burchell suddenly
flung herself upon her knees in such a way
that Mr. Stead thought she would fall and
stretched out his hand to save her. She did
not fall, however, but with clasped hands the
medium continued in a voice of agonized entreaty:</p>

<p>“‘They are killing him. Oh, save him, save
him! The Queen falls on her knees and implores
them to save her life&mdash;they will not
listen. Oh, what tumult! what bloodshed!
How terrible&mdash;they kill him; she pleads in
vain. Now they fling her on one side and stab
her with a dagger, and&mdash;Oh, oh!’&mdash;and
then Mrs. Burchell, exhausted with emotion,
was falling over on her side on the floor when
Mr. Stead got her up and put her on her seat.</p>

<p>“When Mrs. Burchell fell on her knees,
Mrs. Brenchley sprang up, saying, ‘Yes, yes,
I get it in the air. They are killing him; I
see it.’</p>

<p>“‘And I also,’ said Mrs. Manks clasping
hands with Mrs. Brenchley, and both following
her (probably Mrs. Burchell’s) distracted
cries and utterances with cries of, ‘Yes, yes!
We see it; she is quite right.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Burchell, in her agitation, dropped
the envelope on the floor. Mrs. Brenchley
picked it up and, holding it, continued to describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the scene in an agitation only a little less
than Mrs. Burchell’s, exclaiming, ‘Oh, the
blood&mdash;how horrible! Look, how dark it
becomes; see&mdash;the soldiers are coming upon
us&mdash;shooting down all they meet&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘What are they like?’ asked someone.</p>

<p>“‘They seem to me like Russian uniforms;
but it is dark and I cannot see clearly....’</p>

<p>“‘Now the King is dead!’ she (Mrs.
Brenchley) cried. ‘But, oh, what confusion!
What bloodshed!’</p>

<p>“All these ejaculatory comments were
rapidly uttered as Mrs. Burchell was being
helped to her seat and not much notice was
taken of them at the time. Mrs. Brenchley,
however, declares that she has a lively recollection
of what she saw and what she said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stead turned an inquiring gaze to
Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, who had given him the envelope....</p>

<p>“‘What was in the envelope?’ Mr. Stead
asked.</p>

<p>“‘Look!’ said Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. Opening the
envelope he took out a sheet of note-paper on
which was the signature, ‘Alexander.’</p>

<p>“‘It is the King,’ he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said Mr. Stead, ‘her description&mdash;was
it correct?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘It was exact,’ replied Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. ‘The
palace, the King, the Queen. Her description
is exact.’</p>

<p>“And then the medium, who had been
silent as if recovering from the emotion
through which she had just passed, said:</p>

<p>“‘Depend upon it, it will all happen as I
have seen it, if nothing is done to prevent it,
and that ere long!’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Burchell’s own version is that she
added,‘Even then, although they may postpone
it, it will certainly come to pass.’”</p>

Received for $1.25 per Diem&mdash;Dragoleftsky.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time the words “Brigands”
and “Bulgarians” seemed to me synonomous,
for it was not so very long ago, I thought, that
to be kidnapped and behold the tragic story
of your life subsequently illuminating the
pages of every journal, you had only to go to
Bulgaria; and these thoughts were not devoid
of some prestige. But since the days of Pat
Crowe and Raisuli the Bulgarian man-stealers
seem to have forgotten their lines and faded
ignominiously into the wings of the stage of
publicity. In fact, I discovered later, that you
might be just as safe in your room at the
“Grand Royal Hotel” in Sophia as it would
be possible to be in your apartments in any
fashionable hotel in America&mdash;and safer, because
at the “Grand Royal” in Sophia you
are not in the predatorial power of a gang
of domesticated yeggmen disguised as waiters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
porters, bellboys and what not. So we decided
to tempt our fate on a certain June morning
by shaking the dust of Belgrade for that of
the Servian frontier.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">FRUIT VENDERS, NISCH.</p>
</div>

<p>But eight hours’ travel in the local train so
anæsthetized our desires to continue the journey,
on such a train, at least, that the little
vine-clad station at Nisch appealed to us most
invitingly. We also determined then and
there to explore the town behind it.</p>

<p>A two-mile drive over even rougher cobbles
than Belgrade can boast of, connects the station
with the centre of the town, and I might
add that it is the longest two miles I have ever
driven.</p>

<p>As we rattled along, the diminutive one-story
dwellings of Nisch seemed to be scattered
over an unlimited area. A single small
mosque constitutes the only remaining suggestion
that the town was at one time in the
possession of the Turks.</p>

<p>Finally we stopped in front of one of the
hotels&mdash;poor excuses, all of them, believe
me&mdash;and commenced to bargain and barter
for accommodations, only to discover that all
of the rooms were occupied; I doubt if the
place could have housed more than half a
dozen patrons at one time. We tried another
hostelry, with the same result. Then another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
The train on which we had arrived, the last
one leaving Nisch that day in either direction,
had long since departed for Sophia; the hotel
people seemed anything but desirous of taking
us in, for I am dubious about their houses
being so crowded as they were said to be; and
we commenced to consider a suitable place in
which to leave our luggage, so that we might
at least walk the streets that night unencumbered.
Our driver, too, was apparently at his
wits’ end, but after we had tendered him an
extra <em>dinare</em> as a stimulant he <i>thought</i> he knew
of just <em>one more</em> hotel where it <em>might be possible</em>
to obtain rooms, and, accordingly, we
were rattled thither. Here our trials ended,
for the proprietor of this place graciously consented
to accommodate us during our stay.</p>

<p>After first walking through a combination
office and general loafing-room, containing at
one end a bar, reeking with foul-smelling
tobacco-smoke and alive with Servian officers
who shuffled over the sanded floor or played
billiards at an antequated table or sat about
telling the gossip of the garrison, then through
a labyrinth of narrow passages, across a court
and up two flights of stairs, we came upon our
room.</p>

<p>I think we paid about fifty cents a day each
for this room, but in the Balkans you get a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>great deal more for your money at the hotels
than you would dare to expect in America.
The floor was scrupulously polished; clean
bed-clothes were on the beds; fresh water had
been brought up for both drinking and toilet
purposes; spotless white candles projected
from each candlestick; hair-combs and brushes
(for your application if you cared not to doubt
the cleanliness of the previous user) adorned
the bureau; and a gaudy pair of bed-room slippers
reposed beneath each bed, awaiting only
the insertion of your tired toes. Our meals
we ate on the pavement in front of the hotel,
“without restraint or finger bowls,” surrounded
by the army, sniffed at by the dogs
and stared at by the multitude, while a pet
sheep nibbled playfully at our coat buttons.</p>

<p>In Nisch the soldier element ever predominates
over the civilian, for here is located a
Servian garrison of some 2,500 men. Evidently
they consider themselves proficient in
military tactics, for they are always on the
streets, and the pavements in front of the
hotels are constantly crowded with officers,
smoking and drinking. And every soldier
wears a different uniform. There are blue
coats with white trimmings, white coats with
blue trimmings; there are black trousers with
green stripes and green trousers with black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>stripes, not to mention the brown trousers with
red stripes; there are gray caps with black
visors and black caps without visors. Every
private stops on the street to salute his officer
and every officer stops to salute his superior
officer; the place reminds one of a health resort
for the treatment of St. Vitus’ dance.</p>

<p>The moment you unlimber your camera, the
peasants and townspeople, who are none too
familiar with the habits, customs or pastimes
of English-speaking visitors, crowd around in
veritable droves, until you have to give up in
disgust and resign yourself to the good luck
you may hope to have with your snapshots.
Only a week after we left Nisch an Englishman
was arrested for taking photographs in
and about the city, and he had a very great
deal of trouble in finally convincing the authorities
that his object in making pictures
was entirely inoffensive and <i>not</i> with a view
of better explaining to his home War Department
the position of the Servian fort. As it
was, he was held in Nisch for some days until
the British Minister to Servia demanded his
release.</p>

<p>To say the least, the people of Nisch are
primitive and their looks belie not their methods.
Here, for the first time, I saw put into
practice a process which was in vogue centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
ago; the proprietor of the hotel, after
making out his bill, <em>sanded</em> the wet ink instead
of using a blotter.</p>

<p>There is but one object of absorbing interest
to be seen in Nisch, and that is what once was
a tower of human skulls, erected by the Turks.
This ghastly monument commemorates the
Turkish victory over the Servians near Nisch
in 1809, and it is said to have been composed
originally of twelve hundred of the enemies’
skulls. Now but one remains, too deeply imbedded
in the mud-cement for easy extraction,
and for that reason left undisturbed by the
relic-hunter. When Nisch became Servian all
the skulls which could be found, except this
one, were buried reverently.</p>

<p>Because the time of arrival and departure
of trains in the Balkan States appears to be
a matter of mere conjecture and of little consequence,
it is the custom for travellers to be
at the depot at least an hour before train time.
On the day set for our departure from Nisch
we were awakened at four in the morning, so
that we might have plenty of time to take coffee,
be jolted the two miles over the cobblestones
and wait for the train for Sophia, <em>due
to arrive</em> at Nisch at six o’clock.</p>

<p>The route from the Servian frontier to the
capital of Bulgaria is rich in wild and picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
scenery, for almost immediately after
leaving Nisch steep grades are encountered
and continue until the divide is reached at
Dragoman. From there the line descends
none too gradually and Tzaribrod is the next
stop. At this point the Servian crew surrenders
the train to the care of the Bulgarians,
a perfunctory customs examination is made of
your baggage and you turn the hands of your
watch an hour faster to “East European
Time.” Beautiful mountain scenery marks the
remainder of the journey, and in exactly six
hours after leaving Nisch (including the hour
change of time) you are in Sophia.</p>

<p>When you alight from the train don’t think
you have made a mistake and wax discouraged
because you did not locate Sophia immediately,
for almost all of these Balkan towns
have an unhandy habit of springing up some
two or three miles inland from their respective
railway stations. You have only to jump into
one of the numerous open cabs which meet
all trains, each of a different and distinct Renaissance
design, and make signs that you
wish to be driven to the Hotel So-and-So.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A STREET SCENE, SOPHIA.</p>
</div>

<p>During the ensuing voyage, your driver, in
red fez and baggy, ill-fitting Turkish bloomers,
will, by deft manipulation of the reins,
graze more lamp-posts and curb-stones without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
regard to speed limits or to the possible
scattering of his fares <em>en route</em> than any fire-engine
driver it has ever been your misfortune
to come in contact with. Yelling with the full
power of his leather lungs, sometimes at his
animals and sometimes at the foolhardy Bulgarians
who may get in his way, he will jolt
you diagonally across trolley tracks and swing
you dangerously around corners, now on the
port tack and now on the starboard, like an
ambulance driver on a hurry call.</p>

<p>Finally, and suddenly, his horses stop literally
on a ten-cent piece in front of the hotel;
you feel around to ascertain if your frame is
intact and the tempo of your heart-beats once
more assumes a natural rhythm. Bowing
peasants with bared heads (the reason for the
ceremony is known only to themselves, but I
have a suspicion that they all hope to receive
from you some gratuity for living) line the
sidewalk, while the hotel proprietor graciously
assists you to alight and escorts you to your
rooms, at the same time making profuse apologies
for the style and period of their appointments.</p>

<p>For the Bulgarian equivalent of one dollar
and a quarter a day each, you may lodge and
feast at this hotel. You will find the food of
great variety and the cooking excellent; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Turkish coffee, which is always to be had in
these Eastern provinces, and to learn the making
of which you must attempt an excursion
into the culinary department, is the best you
have ever tasted; and delicious wine or refreshing
beer, the latter served temptingly in tall,
thin, frosted glasses, is included in the price
paid.</p>

<p>Perhaps your apartments consist of a suit
of rooms on the second floor, overlooking a
thickly wooded park, which occupies the whole
of the block opposite. The floors are hard
wood parquetry and the sitting-room is furnished
like a throne chamber with plush-covered,
handsomely carved, high-backed chairs
and divans. In one corner stands an immense
tile stove, a replica of those to be seen in
Vienna, resembling more a sarcophagus than
a heater. The bed-room contains two beautifully-carved
beds, burdened with thick, soft
feather comforters, while at the side of each
is placed a small stand bearing an attractive
electric reading lamp. The only complaint
I had to make was that the thousands of jackdaws,
which held daily conclave in the park
during the early hours of the morning, kept
up such an incessant squawking and screeching
that, had our sleeping apartment not been
the more remote from the street, I should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>begged the proprietor to give us a back room.
As it was, we were compelled to bury our
heads, ostrich-like, under the feather comforters
to deaden the racket, although the season
was mid-summer.</p>

<p>Your comfort during your stay having been
assured, you will hurry to the street to mingle
with the people of Bulgaria and to get acquainted
with their capital, this noisy little
city of Sophia, situated snugly at the foot of
the snow-capped Balkans, the majestic Mount
Vitosch to the south.</p>

<p>The streets of the new town, each named
after some local celebrity of the era of liberation,
radiate like the spokes of a wheel from
the royal palace as a hub. They are well-paved,
wide and well-lighted with electricity,
but within the precincts of the old town, now
fast disappearing, you may still find many
narrow cross streets and courts, lined on either
side with picturesque Turkish bazaars which
continually invite your patronage.</p>

<p>During our stay in Sophia the trial was
being conducted of the twenty-year-old assassin
who murdered the Prime Minister a few
months previously. The opposite side of the
street from the law courts was daily thronged
with inquisitive townspeople, hoping to obtain
a glimpse of the boy-murderer, as he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>being taken to and from the prison. He was
found guilty and executed.</p>

<p>A wonderful panoramic view of the city
and of the surrounding country, a view that
will amply repay you for the almost hazardous
carriage ride over worse than miserable roads,
may be had from the foot-hills beyond the
little village of Dragoleftsky, some eight miles
to the eastward. Here you may also get a
glimpse, at short range, of how the Bulgarian
peasant lives and has his being. You will see
the women washing clothes in a crude tub,
hewn out of the trunk of a tree, a tub that
looks not unlike some kind of “dugout”
canoe; while an <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">olla podrida</i> of geese, chickens,
pigs and children swarm on the bare floor
of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Should you proceed farther into the mountains,
on foot, of course, you will come upon
one of the enormous monasteries which were
the heart and soul of the movement for Bulgarian
liberation, and around which most of
the fighting against the Turks took place.</p>

<p class="center">BULGARIA AND HER PAST</p>


<p class="hang50">Progress of Bulgaria&mdash;Origin of her Peoples&mdash;The Bulgari&mdash;First
Russian Invasion of Bulgaria&mdash;The Assenide Dynasty&mdash;Turkish
Tyrannies&mdash;Emancipation of Bulgaria&mdash;Russia’s
Intrigues against Prince Alexander&mdash;The Late
Balkan Disturbances.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> now, for a moment, let us look at the
serious side of this little warlike principality
which has only recently wiggled from under
the vassalage of Turkey, at the same time
proclaiming her absolute independence, and
which, to my mind, is the Bulwark of the
Balkans.</p>

<p>Although having enjoyed but a short thirty-one
years of partial independent existence,
for it is the youngest of the Balkan States,
the progress of Bulgaria during that thirty-one
years has been little short of remarkable.
A visitor to the country is at once impressed
with the look of indomitable determination
that characterizes the features of the Bulgars.
That indomitable determination has convinced
the outside world of their worthiness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>freedom as a state conferred upon them in
1877; it will continue in the future to convince
the outside world of their worthiness of the
indefinite prolongation of this freedom.</p>

<p>It is impossible to recognize in the proud,
full-blown kingdom of to-day the down-trodden
province of Turkey of three decades
ago. In thirty years Bulgaria has built more
than four thousand three hundred primary
schools; she has established, and maintains, a
standing army of one hundred and twenty
thousand men and is capable of putting in the
field in time of emergency two hundred and
fifty thousand more; the value of her annual
exports has reached the figure of $250,000,000;
seventy per cent. of her total area has been
rendered susceptible to the highest degree of
cultivation; the agricultural and stock-raising
adaptability of her peoples has opened the
eyes of all Europe; while her ottar of rose
industry, down in the little valley of Toundja,
“The Rose Valley,” has become world-renowned.</p>

<p>But to fully appreciate and feel this miraculous
development we must delve, briefly, into
Bulgaria’s past.</p>

<p>The ancient Roman name of Thrace was
the one generally applied to the entire territory
lying between the Macedonian frontier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>and the Danube River, while the territory
to the north of the Balkans was then called
Moesia. Savage tribes, known as the Thraco-Dacians,
the Thraco-Illyrians and the Thraco-Macedonians,
held sway over the whole of the
Balkan Peninsula until, historians tell us,
Philip and his successor, Alexander, came
upon and took the country. The date of the
beginning of Roman conquests in Thrace is
indefinite, but it remains an undisputed fact
that Vespasian annexed the country and proclaimed
it a Roman province in <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 75.</p>

<p>The Slavs, moving westward from their
confines in Asia, and having waged successful
warfare upon the Huns and the Goths, populated
Bulgaria between the third and the
seventh centuries. They introduced their customs
and language throughout a large part
of eastern and southeastern Europe, and their
descendants, influenced, of course, by the later
dominant races, constitute the present population
of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>At this point of history we hear for the first
time of the Bulgari, “a horde of Asiatics of
Turkish strain,” who were also destined to be
a prime factor in the general make-up of the
present-day Bulgarians. They swarmed over
the country in the seventh century and
founded the first Bulgarian empire, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>attained its height between the years 893 and
927 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> under the Tzar Simeon, only to fall
ignominiously under Byzantine rule hardly a
century later.</p>

<p>In the year 965, Greece endeavoured to subject
Bulgaria to her power, and the Emperor
Nikephoros Phakos sought aid in his undertakings
from a tribe of Northmen (and we
have every reason to believe that this tribe was
composed of the antecedents of the Russians
of to-day) under a leader named Sviatoslav.
Sviatoslav condescended to become an ally of
the Greeks, but the latter became so jealous
of his many successful conquests in their behalf
that they grew afraid of him and finally made
a treaty with the Bulgarian Tzar, Boris II.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Nikephoros, Sviatoslav
decided to make war on Bulgaria for his own
aggrandizement, and in 969 he captured Boris,
carrying him as far east as Philippopolis.
Here the Greek Emperor, Zinisces, the successor
of Nikephoros, with the help of the
defeated Bulgarians themselves, drove the
Northmen back. Sviatoslav was compelled to
seek refuge in Silistria, where he sustained a
siege of three months. After his final capture
he was liberated and allowed to return to his
native land, but, while on the march, he and
his few surviving adherents were ruthlessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>slain by a marauding band of hostile tribesmen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_115"><img src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE SAINT CRAL CATHEDRAL, SOPHIA.</p>
</div>

<p>This may be said to have been the first Russian
invasion of Bulgaria, the direct result of
which was the fusion of the Northern and the
Southern Slavs. Bulgarian history proper
begins, however, with the nation’s conversion
to Christianity under the Tzar Boris, late in
the ninth century. About the same time the
Cyrillic alphabet&mdash;now adopted by all Slav
peoples, including the Russians&mdash;was introduced
by the great apostles, Cyril and Methodius.</p>

<p>Under Assen, Bulgaria, then belonging to
Greece, revolted, conquered, and Assen I, the
founder of the Assenide dynasty, was chosen
Tzar. This dynasty reached its height under
Assen II (1218-1241) and a century later the
country fell under Servian rule; to its advantage,
however, for King Dushan of Servia
proved himself a wise and jealous protector.</p>

<p>After the death of King Dushan, the Northern
provinces of the Balkan Peninsula commenced
to feel the effects of Turkish invasions.
For some years the Bulgarians defended their
lives and their property heroically; but, finally,
Tzar Shishman III, having been deserted by
his allies, surrendered and acknowledged himself
a subject of Sultan Murad I. Not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> until
after the bloody battle of Kossovo
in 1389 was Bulgaria brought completely
under Ottoman rule.</p>

<p>For the following five hundred years the
Turks pillaged and sacked the country and
outraged its inhabitants. Europe remained
in ignorance of the atrocities, for her mind
was distracted by her own sanguinary wars.
The Ottoman domination and tyranny was
social as well as political; it was felt keenly,
not only in manners and morals, but in social
liberty also. Nevertheless, it is a singular fact
that no determined attempt to assimilate Bulgaria,
as a whole, to Turkish customs and
Mohammedanism was made during all these
years. The only instances of religious coercion
were prevalent in the cases of young Bulgarian
girls who had been snatched from their
very doorsteps and placed in the harem of
some bigoted Pasha.</p>

<p>Even the Crimean War of 1854-56, which
resulted in the liberation of Roumania from
Ottoman rule, brought no relief to oppressed
Bulgaria. The Turks seemed to persecute the
Christians more terribly after it than before.
In 1876 Gladstone’s vitriolic speeches, in the
exposure of Turkish atrocities and demanding
the emancipation of Bulgaria, were heeded,
and the successful defence of Shipka Pass was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>not in vain. Bulgaria became a principality
under Alexander; but, after a successful war
with Servia as the aggressor, Russia instigated
a conspiracy against him which led to his ultimate
abdication.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_119"><img src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE RUINED CHURCH OF SAINT SOPHIA, SOPHIA.</p>
</div>

<p>With glowing promises of promotion, Russia’s
agents, Bendereff and Greuff by name,
were bribed to influence Bulgarian officers to
turn traitors to the Prince. Parts of two regiments
and the cadets of the military college
at Sophia, all more or less under the influence
of liquor, invaded the palace on the night of
August 21st, 1886, and ordered Alexander, at
the point of drawn revolvers, to sign an illegible
document which he was told was his abdication
paper. He was forthwith carried
aboard his own private yacht, taken down the
river and delivered to the Russian authorities
at Reni, where, for a time, he was held prisoner.</p>

<p>Then Europe, indignant, lent a hand and
secured his liberation. Re-entering Sophia on
September 3, he assumed triumphant control,
for his people, incensed beyond measure at
such intrigue, awaited anxiously his home-coming.
Bendereff and Greuff were tried and
convicted by court-martial, but Russia, Germany
and Austria demanded that they should
be released.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>Upon the final abdication of Alexander, the
Bulgarian Sobranje, or Parliament, elected
unanimously Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,
the present ruling “Tzar of the Bulgars,”
as his newly acquired title reads.</p>

<p>As a part of the history of present-day Bulgaria,
principally, and of the Near East, generally,
it would be unwise to exclude from
these pages a brief rehearsal of the late eruptions
in that part of Europe, which have
proven the futility of international treaties
and, at the outset of the troubles, tended to
shatter the pacific exertions of the Old World.</p>

<p>This time Bulgaria exploded the percussion-cap,
and the primary cause of the resulting
imbroglio was a strike of the employees of
the Orient Railway, which threads its way
through the country from west to east, but
which is really Turkish property, for it is
operated under a concession from the Porte
that does not expire until January 1, 1958,
although it thrives under the protection of
Austria, and is capitalized largely by Germany.</p>

<p>Bulgarian troops occupied the railway line
provisionally during the strike but, when an
agreement was effected, refused to relinquish
the road to the officers of the Oriental Railways
Company.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_123"><img src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption"> MONUMENT TO THE “TZAR LIBERATOR,” SOPHIA.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>While Bulgaria’s answer to a formal request
by Turkey to surrender the railway still
hung fire her people were aroused to fever
heat by an untoward incident that took place
in Constantinople: Their representative at the
Porte failed to find his name included in the
list of guests invited to be present at an international
diplomatic banquet. Turkey’s apology
for this slight came too late, for the then
Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria had already
repaired to the ancient capital, Tirnova, probably
out of pure sentiment, and was solemnly
crowned “Tzar of the Bulgars” on Monday,
October 5th, 1908.</p>

<p>Thus did Bulgaria bring into play a lame
excuse to break faith with the Powers of Europe,
which, in a clause of the Treaty of Berlin,
signed by them in 1878 (but not signed
by Bulgaria, and therefore it can hardly be
said that Bulgaria <em>broke</em> the treaty), compelled
Bulgaria to pay a yearly tribute to
Turkey for certain concessions of territory,
including the province of Eastern Roumelia.</p>

<p>Three days after Bulgaria’s proclamation,
Austria, in direct violation of this same Treaty
of Berlin, declared her intention (and later
fulfilled the same) of usurping for her own
the one-time Servian provinces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, over which she had been appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
guardian. This move provoked the
Servians to clamour for war with Austria
while Montenegro swore her allegiance to
Servia. It looked for a time as if King Peter
of Servia would be forced to abdicate in favour
of his son George, the Crown Prince,
or fulfil the demands of his super-patriotic
subjects; and even king-killing is not a lost
art in Belgrade.</p>

<p>To further the dismemberment of Turkey
in Europe, the Island of Crete declared itself
Grecian territory, and Albania, also inoculated
with the serum of liberty, commenced to howl
for independence and courted the sponsorship
of Italy.</p>

<p>For several obvious reasons the convention
of the original signatories of the Berlin Treaty
for the promulgation of European peace was
at that time impossible. Great Britain would
not consent to such a convention unless all
agreed that the original treaty should not be
changed, but that the present issues alone
should be discussed; Russia would not consent
to such a convention unless the clause
which barred the Dardanelles to the passage
of Russian war vessels was struck in advance
from the original treaty; Austria refused to
be a part of such a convention unless her
annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>acknowledged in advance by the other Powers.</p>

<p>At a conference held in the interests of permanent
peace, France, Russia and Great
Britain submitted tentative plans, which were
promptly adopted, for the re-distribution of
authority in the Balkan provinces, the most
important decision being that Bosnia and
Herzegovina go permanently to Austria. The
original stipulations of the Treaty of Berlin
did not even have a hearing. France, of
course, blamed Germany for instigating the
troubles in order to humiliate Great Britain
and force the “Young Turks’ Party,” which
compelled the Sultan to acknowledge a new
constitution and later dethroned him, to re-adopt
the old régime, under which Germany
is alleged to have benefited greatly by trade
with Turkey. Germany, in turn, felt slighted
at not having been invited to join Great Britain,
France and Russia in the drawing up of
their proposals. For a time the guy-ropes
of the European peace-tent were stretched
mighty taut. Had just one of them parted
there would have been the liveliest scramble
among the Powers for Balkan territory that
Europe had seen in many a day.</p>

<p>Although Bulgaria complied with the demand
of Turkey that the Roumelia tribute be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>capitalized, Turkey was loth&mdash;and is yet, for
that matter&mdash;to acknowledge the independence
of Bulgaria or the annexation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina by Austria; Antivari, Montenegro’s
only seaport, enjoyed for a time a
splendid view of an Austrian war fleet; Montenegro
claimed, but failed to collect, indemnity
from Austria for the detention by officials
on Austrian territory of a special Montenegrin
envoy to Servia; and the strained relations
between Austria and Servia took on a
ridiculous aspect by Austria’s refusal to allow
war materials to be imported into Servia
through her domain ... about the only way
Servia would be able to obtain such materials.</p>

<p>Bulgaria said she had been preparing for
a possible war with Turkey for ten years, and
it is a known fact that, although barely one-fifth
the size, in population, of the Ottoman
Empire, she could have placed in the field
fully as many men, some three hundred and
seventy-five thousand, vastly better drilled
and better versed in the tactics of war. The
expenses of keeping the reserve forces with
the colours during the recent disturbances and
the “compensations” which she had to pay
because of her prince’s assumption to the title
of “Tzar” were met by increased taxes upon
her peasantry, and upon the apathy or enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of this peasantry would have depended
the defeat or victory of Bulgarian arms in a
war with Turkey. In advent of hostilities,
however, it is safe to say that the pugnacious
Bulgarians, with Austria nagging them on,
would have bade fair to sweep the Turk from
the map of Europe.</p>

<p>Had the unsatisfied Servians, on the other
hand, been foolish enough to force themselves
into war with Austria, the continuance of
Servia as a nation would have been doubtful
indeed. It would be difficult to imagine an
alliance between the Servians, including the
Montenegrins, and the Turks, their life-long
enemies, but under the conditions at that time
such a thing was not out of the question.</p>

<p class="center">A BULGARIAN MARKET</p>

<p>Bulgaria’s Busy Day&mdash;The Orient Express.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> to the people of the Bulgaria
of to-day, the most advantageous place and
time to study them is in the market square
of Sophia of a Friday morning. This scene
is alone worth the trip to the Bulgarian capital,
for I doubt very much if its equal, in the
number and variety of types, or in the kaleidoscopic
effects of its constantly vibrating
patches of colour, can even be approached in
any other European city.</p>

<p>From seven in the morning until one in the
afternoon the entire town wears a circus-day
air. The square surrounding the principal
mosque swarms with a hawking, bantering
multitude of Greeks, Jews, Russians, Turks,
Roumanians, Serbs and Bulgarian peasants,
all in gala dress; and as for tongues you might
well imagine yourself living in the good old
times in the immediate vicinity of the Tower
of Babel. Here, as I have said, you may observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the characteristics of the natives to the
best possible advantage, for one of the chief
sources of interest in this little-travelled principality
or, in truth, throughout the whole of
the Balkan Peninsula, is its simple-minded,
unsophisticated country people; unsophisticated,
except in occasional brigandage in the
sparsely settled districts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_131"><img src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption"> “A HAWKING, BANTERING MULTITUDE ... IN GALA DRESS.”</p>
</div>

<p>The market is opened officially at seven
o’clock, but long before that hour the peasants,
representing many square miles of surrounding
territory, begin to arrive on foot,
on horseback and in bullock carts. That time-worn
adage about the early bird holds true
even in Bulgaria, for those who dispose of
their produce the quickest and who, consequently,
return home with the greatest number
of shekels jingling in their leathern money
pouches, are the ones who obtain the most
desirable stands along the curb, by appearing
early upon the scene.</p>

<p>By the time the Muezzin pops out to chant
his doleful “Allah el Allah” from the narrow
balcony at the top of the mosque pinnacle, the
square below is already well-filled and from
all directions the tardy ones continue to pour
in. The unpacking and arrangement of produce
and the chatter and gossip among the
peasants themselves occupy the early morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>hours before the official opening of the market,
for soon the wholesale merchants and townspeople
will be dodging in and out, bent on
obtaining the lowest quotations, and then there
will be no time to talk over the happenings
of the intervening week since the last market.</p>

<p>Over there on the curb a swarthy, fur-coated
individual has just halted his puny
pack-animals, whose dust-covered flanks tell
that they have tottered many miles under the
bulging loads of wood. It is no wonder that
their master perspires as he tugs at the ropes
to relieve the little beasts, for, if you examine
his clothing, you will wonder how he came to
get mixed in the seasons. Although the glare
of the sun is nothing if not calorific, this fellow’s
legs are bundled closely in thick, woollen
stockings tied with thongs, while on his back
and reaching clear to his knees he wears a
heavy sheepskin coat turned wrong side out.
But the particular style in which he wears this
coat proves beyond an atom of doubt that he
knows as well as you the time of year, for in

<p class="caption">BULGARIANS IN GALA ATTIRE.</p>
</div>

<p>Now look, if you please, at this group of
Bulgarian belles from the mountains&mdash;symphonies
in lavender. The ribbons in their hair
are lavender, the embroidery on their jackets
is lavender, their long underskirts and aprons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>are lavender, the linings of their sunshades are
lavender. How conscious they are of the tawdry
effect of their fine raiment, as they strut
about through the dust in the middle of the
street! At their heels stalk, jealously, three
Bulgarian beaux, also gorgeously attired for
the occasion in their Sunday-go-to-meetings.</p>

<p>On the other side of the street two women,
each of whom looks to be little less than a
hundred years of age, are spreading aprons
on the dust-covered sidewalk and arranging
thereon their baskets and bundles. They will
sell you the finest, most delicious cherries you
have ever closed your teeth upon for forty
<em>centimes</em> a litre; and strawberries!&mdash;well,
you just can’t wait to buy a basket of such
strawberries at the same price as the cherries.
They are large and luscious but a litre really
does not weigh enough to get a great number
of fruit, for each one is worth at least two
bites. I am not stretching the tape a hair’s
breadth when I say that I have measured Bulgarian
strawberries four and one-half inches
in circumference.</p>

<p>Down the street now comes a parade of
bullock carts, laden with wool. The clumsy
animals lumber lazily along, while the drivers,
one of whom walks in front of each team, tap
deftly with their long poles first one beast and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>then the other between the horns, to remind
them to stay awake until they arrive at the
market. The carts are heavy affairs and look
for all the world like some sort of ancient chariots.
And I may state here that the bullock,
a prototype of the water-buffalo of the Far
East, is a domestic animal commonly found
in Bulgaria, and for what reason it was originally
imported to the country I have often
wondered. Nevertheless, it seems thoroughly
acclimated, and is used as a beast of burden
by the peasants and farmers, not only on the
plains but in the mountains as well, where, you
might imagine, its awkwardness and weight
would be to its disadvantage in negotiating
the rocky roads.</p>

<p>In the slender shadow of the mosque tower
another heavily-clothed peasant and his wife
are engaged in selling live stock. The woman
fondles a suckling pig under her left arm,
while, with her free hand, she holds another,
head downward, by the hind feet. Each of
these pigs may be purchased for two <em>francs</em>,
and for three, a live lamb from the husband.
A pair of spring chickens brings the same
ridiculous price as a suckling pig.</p>

<p class="caption">A GROUP POSED FOR THE CAMERA AT THE FRIDAY MARKET, SOPHIA.</p>
</div>

<p>In wedging your way through the crowd,
which by this time surges over the entire
square and overflows into the adjacent streets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>you stumble over an old Turkish woman, in
baggy, yellow bloomers and curved-toed slippers,
who has deliberately spread her array
of embroideries in the very centre of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>At the noon hour, when the Muezzin again
calls the faithful to prayer, the market is at
its height. From a distance, the monotonous
drone of the street-cries sounds like the hum
of a myriad insects, the swelling cadenzas of
which, as they float out upon the soporific
atmosphere, may be heard in any part of the
city.</p>

<p>At last the peasants, after a profitable holiday
in town, prepare to start on their homeward
journey. By the middle of the afternoon
the last solitary vender has departed with
his pack-animals or his bullock cart, his fur
coat and his woollen stockings. Then the
street cleaners and street sprinklers take the
square in hand. They sprinkle the dust and
scrub the pavement and in half an hour you
would not have believed that that same square
was the place from which emanated, but a
short time before, the Babelonic hum-drum of
hundreds of perspiring market-people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may be the fashion, but it is altogether
exasperating, to be called at five-thirty in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>morning, in order to take a train which leaves
at eight-fifteen. “But when in Rome&mdash;”
at all events, we arrived at the depot exactly
one hour before the time set for the departure
of the “Orient Express,” which was to carry
us back to Belgrade. But we felt in no wise
lonesome, for many others who wished to take
the same train had come to the depot even
before us. The proprietor himself accompanied
us from the hotel and consumed the
time taken to drive the distance by asking us
repeatedly to “make a recommend” in America
for his hostelry, and which we gladly consented
to do. When the train arrived he bade
us good-bye with tears in his eyes, and graciously
kissed the hands of the ladies of the
party.</p>

<p>According to our ideas, the word “Limited”
as applied to the “Orient Express”
was a misnomer; in fact the only “limited”
qualifications of the train which we were able
to discover were its limited speed and its limited
number of up-to-date conveniences. And
there is one thing peculiar about travelling
through these countries: no matter upon
which side of the train you may take your
seat, whether the train goes east or west, north
or south, whether it be morning or afternoon,
your side will be the sunny side. I believe if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>we had crawled under the seats on some of the
trains the sun would have shone up through
the bottom of the car. Perhaps we were
clothed too heavily, or, perhaps, we only travelled
when the sun was exceptionally hot, but,
whichever the cause, we sweltered and perspired
through almost every railway trip we
ever took in the Balkans.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the “limited” features of
the “Orient Express” we were always glad
to have a chance to travel on it, if for no other
reason than to enjoy our fellow-passengers
and amuse ourselves by the humour of the
signs, which are tacked up in conspicuous
places in every compartment, to be heeded by
the traveller. “Gentlemen must not go to
bed with their boots on,” read one of these
placards, and if the railway must needs have
signs to warn its passengers against such a
breach of travel etiquette, we thought what a
delicate piece of business it must be for the
porter or the conductor to enforce the rule;
for travellers are apt to act in a manner just
contrary to the notices of warning they see
posted.</p>

<p>Another sign informed the passenger that
“the conductor would shine gentlemen’s boots
upon request.” Evidently the railway company
had not anticipated the patronage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>ladies, but, if they had, they hardly presumed
that ladies would require a “shine” or that
they would retire with “their boots on.”</p>

<p>It was on this train, too, that we saw the
only Americans we had seen or were destined
to see for many weeks, two jovial rug-hunters
of New York, <em>en route</em> home from a business
trip to Constantinople. Also included in the
collection of passengers was an immaculate
Englishman, with coat tightly buttoned and
gloves on, who sat all day in one position for
fear of disturbing one molecule of dust, and,
owing to his efforts, becoming redder in the
face as the train proceeded.</p>

<p class="center">SARAJEVO&mdash;THE SPIRED CITY</p>


<p class="hang50">From Belgrade to Sarajevo&mdash;The Turkish Bazaar&mdash;A Bosnian
Street Sprinkler&mdash;Horse-races at Ylidze&mdash;A Dervish Dance.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is by no means an uninteresting nor an
unpleasant train ride of seven hours and a
half across the well-kept, fertile farm lands
of Austria-Hungary; from Belgrade, in Servia,
southward to the little junction town of
Brod. This line continues through Agram to
Fiume, Hungary’s solitary seaport, but if you
would visit the Austrian provinces of Bosnia
and the Herzegovina, nominally Turkish territory,
you must change at Brod and take your
compartment in one of the miniature cars of
the little narrow-gauge train which, later,
puffs and snorts its tortuous, labyrinthine way
across, between and under the mountains, up
grade and down to Sarajevo, Mostar and,
finally, Gravosa on the Adriatic Coast.</p>

<p>Before Bosnia (including Croatia and the
Herzegovina) was placed under the suzerainty
of Austria-Hungary by the Treaty of Berlin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>of 1878&mdash;a treaty time-worn and often honoured
in the breach&mdash;the traveller, in order
to cover the one hundred thirty-eight miles
between Brod and Sarajevo, was compelled
for comfort’s and safety’s sake to resort to
the springless mail cart of the Austrian Consulate
in Bosnia and spend forty-eight weary
hours <em>en route</em>. If, on the other hand, he
wished to be lavishly independent and hired a
native conveyance for the journey, three nights
would have to be spent on the road, sleeping in
<em>khans</em> and fearful of his very life.</p>

<p>Although, in point of geographical position,
it was the nearest neighbour of civilized
Europe, the social condition of Bosnia was at
that time the most barbarous of all the provinces
of European Turkey. Not one man in
a hundred knew how to read, and there was
not a single, solitary bookshop throughout the
length and breadth of the province. While
the soil teemed with various valuable minerals,
its hills thickly wooded with virgin forests, its
plains and valleys fertile, well-watered and
productive, its commerce was contemptible.
Under Turkish rule, <em>plums</em> constituted the
most valuable article of trade.</p>

<p class="caption">THE AUSTRIAN ARMY BARRACKS AT SARAJEVO.</p>
</div>

<p>To-day all this is changed. The fields are
cultivated; mines have been prospected and
developed; public schools are everywhere and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>education is compulsory; the Austrian army
has put an end to the maraudings of the Mohammedans
and polices the country, having
its headquarters in great garrisons in Mostar
and Sarajevo. An admirably operated railway
line eats its way throughout the entire
length of the province, the proposed extension
of this railway through the Turkish vilayet
of Novi-Bazaar having been one of the bones
of contention between the Sublime Porte and
the Austrian Government but a short while
ago.</p>

<p>As fate will have it, the express train leaves
Brod at midnight, and, consequently, some of
the most picturesque mountain scenery along
the route is lost to the traveller, but as he does
not reach Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, until
ten o’clock the following morning, an early
awakening will be rewarded with wild mountain
scenes and interesting types galore.</p>

<p>The mere mention of a narrow-gauge train
seems to convey to the average American the
unpleasant idea of discomfort, if not hardship,
of travel, but this train will prove itself clean
and comfortable far in excess of your expectations.</p>

<p>Each section of the railway carriage comprises
two single seats, facing each other as
in our own sleeping cars, and there are <i>no</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>upper berths. Furthermore, you may draw
the curtains of your section and, although it
is not possible to retire in the true sense of
the word, you will enjoy being screened, during
the night at least, from the stares of your
over-curious fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason I had neglected
to draw the curtains of my compartment after
I had prepared myself for the night. Across
the aisle a Bosnian occupied somewhat more
than his allotted space, and when he learned,
by quizzing me surreptitiously in German as
to my nationality, that I was from America,
he launched a volume of questions in my direction,
the answers to some of which, I confess,
rendered me nonplussed for the moment and
sleep impossible.</p>

<p>Was it a long journey from America to
Bosnia?</p>

<p>How long?</p>

<p>Did I come in a steamboat?</p>

<p>Were there many black men in America?</p>

<p>How many?</p>

<p>These queries, and a host of others of the
same stamp, gave me just cause to wonder if
the man had not mistaken me for a travelling
Baedeker. Had he been as tired as I was he
would have enjoyed a night’s rest just as
much as I. Finally, I became desperate and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>jerked the curtains together&mdash;a rude procedure,
no doubt&mdash;and went to sleep with a
volley of interrogations raging about me. If
my Bosnian friend wished to know during the
night aught of the history, topography or
population of the United States, I fail to remember,
having conveniently lost consciousness,
but he was ready with a fresh volume of
questions when I awakened in the morning.</p>

<p>At seven we stopped long enough to take
coffee on the vine-arboured station-porch of
a little village; a short twenty minutes later
the station-master rang his bell, the train conductor
blew his horn and the engineer tooted
his whistle, all of which seem to be absolutely
necessary to start a train in the Balkans, and
we were off again, whisking over the wonderfully
well-kept roadbed, past the water tanks
and the switch towers in their immaculate
coats of fresh, white paint, through tunnels,
across gorges, and in three more hours we
arrived at Sarajevo.</p>

<p>One might as well be precipitated from the
clouds into Turkey itself as to come suddenly
upon Sarajevo from the country in the North.
In this little city it isn’t one Turk here and
one Turk there, as in Belgrade or Sophia, but
more than half the population is Ottoman.
Here the Mohammedan element occupies a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>most interesting bazaar that covers in area
several city blocks; on every hand the pencil-like
pinnacles of the forty-odd mosques rear
themselves skyward; the streets are alive with
red-fezzed Mohammedans in spacious knee
breeches, Turkish women in bloomers and
veiled goddesses of the Harem. At the noon
hour the air reverberates with the cries of the
Muezzins, in response to which the faithful
spread themselves devoutly upon their knees
in the courtyards and on the steps of their
houses of worship.</p>

<p>Sarajevo lies on both sides of the Miljača
River, the banks of which are protected from
the ravages of flood by well-built and not inartistic
stone walls. Mountains surround the
town on all sides. The streets are narrow as
becomes a Turkish city, but under the Austrian
régime they are kept clean as new pins. The
buildings, especially the government ones, are
large and well-proportioned, the shops are
good and the hotels excellent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_153"><img src="images/i_153.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="355" /></a>
<p class="caption">SOME TURKISH HOMES IN SARAJEVO.</p>
</div>

<p>Of course the principal attraction in Sarajevo
is the bazaar, a sort of perennial market
where the Turk and his art may be studied to
advantage. This bazaar is a permanent affair,
divided into streets or lanes which tangle and
twine themselves around a small square centered
by a public fountain. Wednesday is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>characterized by a “grangers’ meeting” and
the streets overflow with Turkish and Bosnian
truck-farmers bartering their produce. This
is the day to rub elbows with the sullen, lazy
Mohammedans. They squat about the fountain,
presumably caring little whether they
sell their fruits and vegetables or not; immense
four-legged loads of hay or wood,
which cover the little pack-animals from nose
to tail, wobble up and down through the narrow
thoroughfares, compelling you to seek
the shelter of a convenient doorway to allow
them to pass; veiled women, with even their
hands shielded by cotton gloves from the admiring
gazes of the men-folk, amble silently
by, ghost-like, while the <em>kafanas</em>, or coffee
houses, buzz with the gossip of outstretched
Turks who sip their coffee and smoke cigarettes
until the place smells like the hybrid of
a tobacco factory and a coffee-packing establishment.</p>

<p>Almost any day of the week, however, the
pound and tinker of sandalled artisans are
to be heard in the workshops which border the
streets of the bazaar. The coppersmith hammers
out his Turkish coffee sets and his brass
trays, many of which he etches with a sharp-edged
tool in ornate designs and figures; the
shoe and harness-maker sits cross-legged as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>plies the needle back and forth, a cigarette
between his lips and a cup of thick, black
coffee ever at his elbow; the gold and silversmith
deftly inlays his gun metal cigarette
cases with threads of precious metals, first
scoring with a tool the design to be worked
upon the object, much as a dentist might prepare
a cavity in a tooth for a gold filling.
You might readily imagine yourself in Damascus,
instead of in the capital of a province
of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>Objects of considerable interest to me in this
Bosnian city were the home-made street
sprinklers which tend to serve the purpose of
the municipal government, although they
never would be regarded by us as labour
savers. A huge hogshead is mounted on four
wheels, filled with water and hauled through
the streets by a horse driven by a native. In
that much the contrivance somewhat resembles
our own variety, except for the native.
But here lies its salient feature: it requires
two men to operate it, for how on earth would
it be possible for one man to drive the horse
and sprinkle the street at one and the same
time, in Bosnia?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_157"><img src="images/i_157.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="381" /></a>
<p class="caption">DOUBLE-DECKED STORES IN THE TURKISH BAZAAR, SARAJEVO.</p>
</div>

<p>From the rear of the hogshead protrudes a
long hose terminating in a sprinkler, like the
nozzle of a watering pot. One end of a rope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>is fastened to this sprinkler, and the other is
attached to a second native, whose duty it is to
walk behind the cart and swing the hose from
side to side by means of the rope, the while
sprinkling himself as well as the roadway.
Wet feet invariably result from this crude
method, but the “man behind the street
sprinkler” should be deemed above his fellows
in point of cleanliness, if such a condition
meets with any commendation whatever in
Bosnia, for the labourers in Sarajevo, as a
rule, look as though they had never been on
intimate terms with soap and water in all their
lives.</p>

<p>In the afternoons horse-races usually take
place at the quaint little summer resort of
Ylidze, at the foot of the mountains, to be
reached either by train or by a rather dusty
drive of eight miles. These races furnish
about the only excuse the fashion and <em>élite</em> of
Sarajevo have to display their dresses and
uniforms. The grandstand and paddock are
packed with Worth gowns and three-foot hats,
(mind you!) and the bookmaker does a land-office
business with the be-medalled and gold-braided
Austrian army. But the real devotees
of the races are the Turks and peasants who
drive for miles and miles to attend them, and
whose Oriental costumes outline in gayest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>colours both sides of the course. In the late
afternoon, at the conclusion of the race-meet,
Bosnian society repairs <em>en masse</em> to the beautiful
and fashionable Villa Bosna, where, in the
cool of the evening, in the casino or under the
great trees, it sups and dines and chatters, until
it is time for the last of the evening trains
to leave for Sarajevo.</p>

<p>Like the Turks of any Eastern city those
of Sarajevo comprise many different sects,
and it was on the day before I took my departure
that a Bosnian porter, whose patron I had
been repeatedly during my stay in the city,
and who took seriously to heart the alleged
fabulous wealth of <i>all</i> English-speaking
people, came to my hotel to ask if I might
care to witness a Dervish dance that evening.
These calisthenic devotions, held by this most
fanatical sect of Mohammedans in their
mosque upon the night of each full moon, constitute
a weird religious ceremony, not excelled
as a spectacle even by the famous Antelope
and Snake Dances of the Hopi Indians,
and I promptly accepted the invitation to
attend.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_161"><img src="images/i_161.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a>
<p class="caption">“THE REAL DEVOTEES OF THE RACES.”</p>
</div>

<p>Shortly after nine o’clock, my guide, the
pronunciation of whose real name sounded so
much like “Jim” that I shall hereafter allude
to him as such, called for me, and together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>we started off for the darkened Turkish
quarter. With Jim in the lead, carrying in
his hand a ponderous Turkish lantern, which
resembled more an oil can than anything I
can think of, we stumbled over the cobbles,
through the narrow streets, past the latticed
windows of the low-roofed Turkish houses and,
after three-quarters of an hour (during which
time I am safe in saying we climbed every hill
in the town) we arrived at the door of the
Dervish mosque.</p>

<p>In the courtyard the bodies of several of the
departed lay in state, as is the Mohammedan
custom before burial. After proceeding
through several rooms and negotiating as best
we could as many flights of dark, precipitous
stairs, we finally found ourselves in a balcony
overlooking the room in which the “dance”
was to take place. On the opposite side of the
balcony from us, behind closely-woven lattice-work,
was seated a group of female admirers
of the dancers. On the floor below, at one end
of the room, stood a shrine, on each side of
which a Dervish apostle sat cross-legged. The
pungent odour of burning incense and candles
filled the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Presently the worshippers, all men, arrived,
removed their slippers and squatted on the
floor facing the altar, forming a semi-circle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>When all were seated, probably thirty in number,
one of the patriarchs near the shrine commenced
a low, dismal chant. After many
repetitions this was memorized by the worshippers,
who then chanted it together, emphasizing
the first beat of a common time
rhythm, their bodies swaying in unison from
side to side. The tempo of the song and the
movement of the bodies accelerated gradually.
At the end of ten or fifteen minutes this particular
chant was stopped abruptly and another
was commenced, which continued for an
equal length of time.</p>

<p>But to worship in a sitting posture did not
seem to produce the desired effect and the
men, at the beginning of the succeeding wail,
arose to their knees to continue the services.
Swinging and grunting in this position tended
to heighten their emotions to a greater extent,
and some of the worshippers became so accustomed
to and numbed by the swaying movement
that they hopped about the floor in a
state of semi-consciousness, their faces engraven
with an almost unearthly look, like
that of sufferers from delirium tremens. At
the end of each chant several required being
led back by their fellows to their original positions
in the semi-circle.</p>

<p>Still they were not satisfied with the result,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>and, after an hour of howling in sitting and
kneeling positions, they stood up to put a more
emotional finishing touch to their devout proceedings.
By this time the floor was littered
with fallen turbans and the rugs used to kneel
upon were scattered about the room. After
several more exhaustive efforts to work off
their superfluous religious ardour had been
resorted to without apparent avail, the men
snatched drums and cymbals from hooks upon
the wall and commenced beating them furiously,
in rhythm to the wails of the priests.
The din produced on these instruments was
almost deafening and the antics and shouts
of the chanting fanatics transformed the place,
literally, into the interior of a madhouse.
During the final scene all were shouting at
once, each trying to outdo the other, as if to
receive some recognition for his religious ability
from the high priests. From time to time
a Dervish would fall upon the floor, completely
enervated but trying, unconsciously,
to continue his part. On the whole it constituted
one of the most repulsive sights of infidel
worship.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven the “dance” was over
and I was quite willing to take up my position
behind Jim and be guided through the
narrow streets back to civilization.</p>

<p>Farther along at Jablaniča&mdash;where, although
a village of but two hundred souls, the
accommodations of a good hotel beckon to the
traveller to spend some time in this vicinity,
should the grandeur of the surrounding mountain
scenery appeal to him as it did to us&mdash;a
gorge of the Narenta is crossed and from
this point the line follows the defile of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>river as far as Mostar. A military road of
stone foundation, which would tempt the most
apprehensive of automobile tourists, twines
itself, like a white thread, along the opposite
side of the river from the railway, now bridging
with stone arches the waterfall of a mountain
stream at its debouchment into the river
below, now circling the base of an overhanging
cliff, now shooting into a short tunnel blasted
through the solid rock. A wall of stone masonry
borders the outer edge of the road at the
dangerous places.</p>

<p>While the adjacent mountains are wild,
rugged and severe in their bleakness, the valleys
between them are fertile and productive.
Almost any cereal which thrives in temperate
latitudes grows readily. Indeed, in travelling
through Bosnia to-day the farms of prosperous
land-owners so stretch themselves across
the undulating sections of country between
the higher mountain ranges that the observer
might easily imagine himself circling a great
agricultural section of England or America.</p>

<p>Jablaniča is a much-patronized summer
resort for the people of both Sarajevo and
Mostar, and from it as a starting-point climbing
excursions into the mountains may be
made in every direction. Responsible guides
will be supplied at the hotel for comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>small sums. The air here is delightfully clear
and invigorating; even on the warmest days
the cooling shade of the extensive gardens
which surround the hotel is much too enticing
to allow one to hurry along to Mostar. As
a quiet, charming place to recuperate, for as
long a time as you will, from the fatigues of
travel in the Balkans, I can suggest a no more
convenient, or a no more fascinating spot than
right here at the hotel in this diminutive village
of Jablaniča. If you do not care to climb
mountains you may revel in a general rest,
for a few days at least. Even the name of the
place requires no special lingual effort to pronounce,
once you become familiar with these
Slavonic combinations; you merely have to
say “Yab-lā-nitz-ā”&mdash;it just sort of rolls
along your tongue from the palate to the lips,
and then drops.</p>

<p>In Mostar, the capital of the Herzegovina,
the sewing-machine advertisements offer
about the only hint that you are living in the
twentieth century, for this city seems to have
adhered more closely to mediæval methods
than any in the Balkans.</p>

<p>The Narenta River, which divides the town,
is a shallow mountain stream at times, but
after a period of heavy rains it surges down
through the mountain gorges and over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>grotesque lavic rocks, ripping away its banks
and necessitating the inhabitants of the town
whose homes border its scaly sides to build
their houses upon stilts.</p>

<p>Mostar may boast of, or bemoan, as the case
may be, a collection of thirty mosques, for, of
its fourteen thousand population, half are Mohammedans,
and two thousand of the remaining
half comprise the troops of an Austria-Hungarian
garrison. The streets of the town
are dirty and narrow, and the sun beats down
between the white walls of the houses as if in
the tropics. A bridge of modern steel construction
spans the Narenta just near the
hotel of that name, while half a mile farther
down the river one of the most famous bridges
in all Europe stretches its single arch out of
the shadows across the sea-blue water of the
Narenta, which gurgles in and out among the
volcanic boulders ninety feet below the key-stone.
The age of this bridge is indeterminable.
It is supposed to have been built by the
Cæsars at a time when the Herzegovina was a
Roman province. Be that as it may, nothing
like its construction or architecture is to be
seen in bridge-building in Europe, no matter
how ancient or how modern, and it is still used
by market-people and the inhabitants of that
quarter of the city. One would almost expect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>to see a centurion or two, in togas and sandals,
walk out across the old structure any minute.</p>

<p>The veiled Turkish women of Mostar are
world-famous for the style of their headdress,
which is as characteristic of this city as the old
bridge itself. In addition to being heavily
veiled they wear a sort of black hood of stiffened
material, which protrudes in front like
the upper half of the pointed bill of a bird.</p>

<p>But, aside from the Roman bridge, the
veiled women, and an old Turkish graveyard,
there is really nothing much of interest in
Mostar. At any rate, after a short visit here,
you will be a little tired of the sameness of
these cities, which the Turk fain would still
hold as his own, and you will want to hurry
along to the Dalmatian coast towns, as different
from those you have recently visited as
day is from night; different climates, different
peoples having different customs, different
architectures; all so different that when you
come upon them you will wonder if you
haven’t been awakened suddenly, then launched
upon another dream-excursion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE OLD ROMAN BRIDGE, MOSTAR.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, after leaving Mostar, the railroad
commences to climb, snake-like, over the mountains
toward the coast, for the building of this
road has required no small amount of engineering
skill. It would be difficult to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>in England or America, or in fact in any other
country, a railway line more substantially
built or kept in better condition. The crushed
rock track ballast is evened off at each side of
the rails as if with a pair of calipers, the roadbed
is smooth and the grades, although long,
are not as steep as would be imagined, considering
the heights to be climbed. At Ravna
the final ascent of the mountains is commenced
and from here to the top the road is built on
an almost continuous wall of stone masonry.</p>

<p>As you wind around the mountain peaks
wonderful views of the valley below, dotted
here and there with white specks of human beings
busily at work, are before you, now on
one side, now on the other. The fields resemble
square patches of brown or green plush
rubbed both ways, according to the angle of
light as it falls upon them. Ahead, the railway
line seems to be made up of tunnels, great
stone arches that bridge deep ravines and cuts
and fills which follow one another in rapid
succession. On the distant hills you may see
the remains of watch towers once used by lookouts,
from which were observed the movements
of Turkish invaders in the days when the gates
of Vienna were threatened by the depredating
Mohammedans.</p>

<p>A little beyond Uskoplje, as suddenly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>you would come into the light from the darkness
of a tunnel, is displayed before you, as if
molded with clay upon a great flat canvas, a
most extraordinary panorama of that part of
the Dalmatian coast.</p>

<p>Might you have had the uninterrupted view
of the engineer you would have seen at first
but a narrow defile in the mountains ahead,
in the centre of which the rails of the road
meet in perspective, like two glossy ribbons,
and then seem to shoot out into a blue-vaulted
void beyond. By bringing into play a very
little imagination you might be willing to believe
you were nearing the edge of the earth.
But, as you approach, a panorama unfolds itself,&mdash;a
panorama of that strip of territory
which fringes the north-eastern shores of the
Adriatic Sea, Austria-Hungary’s only coast
line. It is a panorama of an historic land of
perennial loveliness. It is a panorama of a
land of flowers, of sunshine and deep shadows;
a land of wonderful walls and bold bastiles;
a land of gayety, where Austria-Hungarian
aristocracy, all-appreciative of its charms, sits
and looks out upon the amethystine waters by
day, and strolls languorously along the sea-parades
by night; a land of quaint, fortified
cities, jealous of their histories; a land of interesting,
picturesque, unsophisticated peasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>peoples. Withal it is a new, and, as yet, comparatively
an unpenetrated land to the English-speaking
traveller, scenery-lover or pleasure-seeker,
and I have taken the liberty to coin
a new name for it&mdash;The Balkan Riviera.</p>

<p>From this point in the defile the road twists
and turns like a scenic railway, and almost
doubles in its tracks as it zig-zags down the
precipitous sides of the mountains, the Adriatic
ever blending into the gray sky-line in the
distance.</p>

<p>Finally, after making in its descent many
snake-like coils, the train passes the source of
the beautiful Ombla, with its swan-dotted lake,
and you will have arrived at Gravosa, the port
and railway terminus of Ragusa. In three
hours, it seems, you have been hustled from a
temperate into a tropical climate.</p>

<p>But for those who do not care for travel
through Bosnia and the Herzegovina there is
a vastly more convenient route, possibly one
that makes a more perfect pleasure trip, by
which to reach this Balkan Riviera, for Trieste,
just across the gulf from Venice, and Fiume,
on the eastern shores of the Istrian Peninsula,
are also gateways to this land of types and
flowers.</p>

<p>If you take steamer from either of these
towns you will be whisked down along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>Dalmatian coast, through the fjord-like passages
between the thousands of islands which
form the tassels to the fringe of country beyond,
and by and by you will come within
sight of that little old town of many vicissitudes&mdash;Ragusa.</p>

<p>It seems almost an enchanted spot and you
will call it “The Fairy City of the Adriatic.”</p>

<p class="center">RAGUSA</p>


<p class="hang50">As She Is&mdash;The First Colony&mdash;The Fire of 1292&mdash;The Black
Death&mdash;Hungary Acquires the Place&mdash;Ragusa Establishes
Her Independence&mdash;Plague&mdash;Earthquake&mdash;Napoleon Takes
Ragusa&mdash;The City Ceded to Austria.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> does Venice in the north, so Ragusa in
the south surpasses in lustre all of those pearl-cities
which dot the Dalmatian shores.</p>

<p>But you must be content, if you come by
steamer, with merely a long-distance glimpse
of your “Enchanted City” for the time being,
because the steamer will put into Gravosa, a
short two knots to the north, where the waters
of its magnificent harbour are of sufficient
depth for safe navigation, and where the docking
facilities are of a more recent vintage.
The noisy little freighters of light draft which
ply up and down this Adriatic coast still make
Ragusa a port of call, however, and the <em>molo</em>
there is by no means a scene of inactivity. The
larger passenger steamers, however, after leaving
Gravosa, do not deign even to hesitate at
Ragusa, but puff by indifferently as if such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>city never occupied space on the map, bound
for Corfu and the Levant.</p>

<p>So here, at Gravosa, you will take a carriage
and drive out through the time-honoured sea-gate
of the town, the blue Adriatic murmuring
below you on one side, and a continuous arbour
of beauty bowing a floral welcome to you
on the other, the short distance to this dream-city
of Ragusa. Immense cacti grow in luxuriance
from out the very walls of stone that
border the road; fig and olive trees clothe the
neighbouring hills in blankets of green velvet;
rows of palmettos rear their scaly trunks by
the roadside and curl their broad leaves to hold
the moisture of the fallen dew.</p>

<p>On approaching nearer to Ragusa a greater
profusion of semi-tropical verdure lends a
charming background to the numerous white-walled,
red-roofed villas which top the rocky
shore line, while a modern hotel, up to date
in all its appointments, looks out from behind
its gardens over the battlements and fortresses
of the old city. In the evening a military band
plays near the wall, which skirts the edge of
one of the cliffs just outside the city gates;
crowds of care-free visitors occupy seats at
the near-by tables, listening to the music, drinking
and gazing out over the brilliant reflection
of the moon upon the water, while at their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>backs the splendid towers of the old fortifications
frown down upon the happy throng, as
if in silent pleading for just a little while in
which to tell of the changes they have seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_181"><img src="images/i_181.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="383" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE HARBOUR OF GRAVOSA.</p>
</div>

<p>The ancient moat surrounding the walls,
now magically transformed into a garden
filled with flowers of every conceivable shape
and colour, is the haven of artists; it is bridged
by a permanent stone arch which leads by
winding passageways through the principal
gate of the city, the Porta Pille, into the Corso
beyond. Above this massive gateway, in a
niche, is placed a small carved statue of the
patron saint of Ragusa, San Biagio. The
Corso, within, is probably two hundred yards
long, wide and paved with stone. On either
side it is bounded by shops, while at the east
and the west ends respectively stand the Custom
House, through which is the exit to the
docks, and the Porta Pille. Just inside the
Porta Pille stands a magnificent fountain of
huge proportions, built in 1435 by the famous
Neapolitan architect, Onofrio di la Cava, who
also, in the same year, perfected the system
still in use for conducting fresh water to the
city from the Gionchetto, eight miles distant,
and re-erected the palace which had been burnt
down in 1432.</p>

<p>Opposite this fountain is the Franciscan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>church of Mala Brača, the doorway of which,
from the point of view of the architect, is
worthy of some study.</p>

<p>Behind the town to the north the barren
slopes of Mount Sergius interrupt the view
inland. It may be interesting for our own
conservationists to note that at one time this
mountain was so thickly wooded that Ragusa
was given the Illyric sobriquet of “Dubrovnik,”
or “The Woody,” but now not a tree
nor a shrub can be seen upon its entire sterile
surface.</p>

<p>Off to the south lies the beautiful islet of
La Croma. Tradition says that Richard Cœur
de Lion, while returning from the Crusades,
was threatened with shipwreck just off this
island. While the storm was raging at its
height, in an attempt to court Divine Providence,
he declared he would build a church
upon the spot where his caravel happened to
be beached if he and his crew be saved from
the fury of the elements. Scarcely had he
finished his prayer when the ship thrust its
prow into the wooded shores of La Croma and
here, to fulfil his promise, he built a chapel.</p>

<p>The history of Ragusa reads like the romance
it is, for it is doubtful if any other city
of Europe has been so tightly and tragically
wound around the finger of Fate.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_185"><img src="images/i_185.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption">RAGUSA,&mdash;MOUNT SERGIUS IN THE BACKGROUND.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>Many conflicting accounts of its founding
have been published, but the real history of
Ragusa begins at the time of the victory of
the Venetians over the Narentines in the struggle
for the supremacy of the Adriatic. Policy
compelled its citizens, descendants of the
refugees from the fallen Illyrian capitals
who have been accredited with the founding
of Ragusa, to favour the Narentines, and with
their fall Ragusa came under the yoke of the
Venetians.</p>

<p>The original city corresponded to the southern
portion or modern Ragusa, but later, the
Romans absorbed a rival colony and included
the whole within the walls which stood, approximately,
on the line of the present fortifications.</p>

<p>In the year 1292 a series of periodical disasters
commenced in Ragusa, the blighting
results of which no city of to-day could possibly
sustain.</p>

<p>On August 16th of that year, while the little
territory was being pillaged by the Servians
in alliance with the people of Cattaro, but a
few miles down the coast, a fire broke out and
destroyed a greater part of the city; at that
time all the houses were built of wood gathered
from the forests of Mount Sergius, all except
the Rector’s castle and the churches. Fire was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>followed by famine and epidemic. Those of
the heart-sick population who survived were
finally persuaded not to abandon the city, public
subscriptions were raised for the destitute
and a new town was built on the same site.</p>

<p>When the great plague, or “Black Death,”
swept across Europe in 1348 eleven thousand
souls were said to have perished within the
walls of Ragusa.</p>

<p>Exactly ten years later Ragusa, then included
in the Dalmatian territory belonging
to Venice, was ceded to Hungary and the payments
of all tributes hitherto given to Venice
were transferred with the country. In return,
Lewis of Hungary pledged himself to protect
Ragusa and to allow her to govern herself,
as had Venice before him.</p>

<p>Under Hungarian protection Ragusa felt
herself develop an extensive power. In this
she was abetted by Lewis himself, who interceded
for her with the Pope for permission to
trade with the Turks. He even allowed her
to elect her own Count and tended her many
other unheard of privileges.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_189"><img src="images/i_189.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="355" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE WALLS OF RAGUSA.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1418 Dalmatia again passed into the
hands of Venice. Then it was that Ragusa
revolted, and, three years later, she established
successfully an independence, which she enjoyed
for almost four hundred years. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>steady commercial progress marked this period
of her history, and it only reached its climax
after the fall of Venice in 1797. As early as
1417 slave-dealing was forbidden in Ragusa
and adjudged by the assembly as “base,
wicked and abominable.” A foundling hospital
was established in 1432, and in 1435
teachers were invited from Italy to instruct
in the public schools.</p>

<p>The little principality became the haven of
many wealthy and noble families from the
Slavonic kingdoms in the interior, who had
been driven from their lands by the marauding
Turks. But Ragusa, on the other hand,
made friends with the deceitful Mohammedans,
traded with them, and, at the same time,
cannily strengthened her fortifications against
them. Ragusa made treaties of commerce
with Spain in 1494, with France in 1508 and
with Egypt in 1510, which latter treaty
smoothed the sea for her along the course to
the East Indies. Her “argosies” (the word
“argosy” means literally “a vessel of Ragusa”)
were to be found in every commercial
port, and, at the time of the fall of Venice,
her mercantile marine had risen rapidly to
more than four hundred sail.</p>

<p>But during this period of trade-building the
misfortunes of Ragusa were many.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>Only by the loyalty and indomitable pluck
of her sons was she able to rise so many times
from her dust and ashes, while the whole world
marvelled at such determination to outlive the
destruction wrought by nature and the elements.</p>

<p>In 1462 plague broke out among the inhabitants
of the town and two thousand people
succumbed to its ravages. The same year a
disastrous fire destroyed the Rector’s palace
and the arsenal.</p>

<p>May 17, 1520, was the date on which commenced
a series of earthquake shocks, which
continued intermittently for twenty months.
Many houses were demolished and it became
the custom of the people to place the passover
mark, I. H. S., above their doors as a devout
entreaty for Divine protection. Finally, the
earthquakes ceased, but six years later the
germs of the plague were carried to Ragusa
in the stuffs of a trader from Ancona. The
unfortunate merchant was dragged through
the streets and tortured by the infuriated,
panic-stricken citizens, the Senate fled to Gravosa,
and only a small guard remained to quiet
and to ease the sufferings of the terrified inhabitants.
For six long months the pestilence
raged within the walls and no less than twenty
thousand souls fell victims to its terrible havoc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>Then Turkey in the east, and Venice in the
west, took advantage of Ragusa’s weakness
and preyed upon her, the Turks especially
making the most of her misfortunes for their
own aggrandizement.</p>

<p>The plague re-appeared from time to time,
and in 1580 and 1639 the town was again visited
by earthquakes.</p>

<p>But the historical bench-mark of Ragusa
was the great seismic disturbance of 1667.
With this as the basis, the dates of all subsequent
or previous events of importance were
calculated; even to-day the people of the town
will tell you that the church of San Biagio was
destroyed by fire “thirty-nine years after <i>the</i>
earthquake.”</p>

<p>Early in the morning of April 6th, 1667,
this great disaster descended without any warning
upon the people of Ragusa. The earth
seemed to roll and vibrate under the internal
pressure; immense fissures were cleft in the
surface and almost every house in the city was
razed to the ground; five thousand citizens,
the Rector of the Republic included among
them, perished. The ruins took fire and the
town was looted by hordes of plunderers; even
the treasures of the churches were carried
away.</p>

<p>Because the Ragusans had made some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>armed resistance against the Turks, many of
whom were among the chief looters, the Sublime
Porte demanded an explanation. Nicola
Bona and Marino Gozze were chosen as peace
commissioners to Turkey, but both were
thrown into prison at Silistria. Two others
that followed suffered the same fate.</p>

<p>Although deluged with misfortunes Ragusa
prospered, but her continued prosperity was
not watched without some jealousy on the part
of the powers of Europe. At the height of
her ascendency, Russia and France both grew
hungry for her, and Russia, aided by the Montenegrins,
bombarded and sacked the city. In
1806 Napoleon took Ragusa, and eight years
later the combined efforts of England and
Austria caused the haughty, supercilious little
principality to be annexed to Austria.</p>

<p>You will find such an exaggerated air of
independence among the Ragusans of to-day
that you will little wonder that they held themselves
for four hundred years against the nations
of Europe and outlived the effects of
their calamities.</p>

<p>I was talking with a native on the Corso
one day and happened to ask him, casually,
what was the nature of the reception the people
of Ragusa tendered the Austrian Emperor
upon the occasion of his visit a short time before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
He seemed offended that I even intimated
that they had given the Emperor a
reception, and assured me that the Ragusans
had taken the matter of his visit as an occasion
of no importance whatever. But he hastened
to tell me in detail of the demonstration
planned for the Crown Prince of Montenegro,
who was expected soon to make a short stay
in the city.</p>

<p>Ragusa, as I have said, is the much favoured
winter resort of the Austrian and Hungarian
aristocracy, and it would be difficult to imagine
a more delightful one. The climate is
ideal. Although the atmosphere is free from
humidity the sun of a summer’s day is quite
hot&mdash;so hot, in fact, that you will be tempted
to indulge in a three-dollar white duck suit
at one of the little shops along the Corso.</p>

<p>The evenings, however, are always agreeably
cool. Then the band plays in the “piazza,”
on the top of the cliff, and the town
awakens from its apparent lethargy. From
the docks the sardine fishermen, after overhauling
their tiny craft, put out to sea in the
evening twilight, to make their nightly catch
among the bays and inlets of the rock-bound
coast. Beyond the bastiles and sea-fortresses
the afterglow of the brilliant sunset tinges La
Croma in hues of purple and gold.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>At night the soft breezes, redolent of the
perfume of the garden below, are wafted
through the latticed windows; the band seems
to play the last number on the program with
irresistible rhythm; the tuneful songs of Austrian
sailors, as they return to their ships in
the harbour of Gravosa after an evening of
revelry, swell out upon the night air and die
away&mdash;and before you realize it the morning
sunlight is streaming through the Venetian
window-shades, forming bars of gold that
stretch across the polished floor, while the sea
glitters and dashes musically against the bases
of the cliffs just a little beyond your window.</p>

<p>Truly, Ragusa is the fairy city of the
Adriatic.</p>

<p class="hang50">Steamer-day at Gravosa&mdash;Ragusa from the Sea&mdash;The Bocche
di Cattaro&mdash;Castelnuovo&mdash;Cattaro and Her Mountain
Background.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">I can</span> assure you that it will be a hard matter
to tear yourself away from Ragusa. You
will want to stroll through her narrow streets,
or watch the market-people in the public
square, or play long sets of tennis on the excellent
courts in the shadows of the turreted
town walls, or sip “citronade” indefinitely
under the awnings of the street cafés near the
Corso. There is a weird, delightful charm
about Ragusa that is well-nigh irresistible.</p>

<p>But just in the midst of ecstatic enjoyment
there always looms up that infallible something,
which will, sooner or later, put an unwelcome
end to all good things; and we finally
found ourselves facing our luggage on the
drive back, along the flower-skirted road to
Gravosa to take the steamer for Cattaro.</p>

<p>As we wound around an overhanging cliff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>we caught sight of the beautiful bay, and were
able for the first time to appreciate its advantages.
Its waters were smooth as a dancing
floor; here and there a smart little launch with
striped awnings darted up and down; across
the harbour the gardens of handsome villas
extended down to the water’s edge, while out
in the roadstead the gray hulls of a squadron
of Austrian sea-fighters silhouetted themselves
against the sky-line.</p>

<p>The <em>molo</em> itself was a scene of animation.
It was crowded with people, peasants, sailors
and tradesmen, for the steamer <em>Codolo</em>
from up the coast had just been made fast,
and the arrival of any passenger steamer is
an event of no little import at Gravosa.</p>

<p>But what of unusual interest did the <em>Codolo</em>
have in store to occasion such wholesale
manifestation of inquisitiveness among the natives
of the town? Even our driver confessed
he had never seen such a gathering on the
<em>molo</em>. The arrival of an official of high rank,
probably. But no, there seemed to be an absolute
dearth of uniformed soldiery, and no state
official could possibly arrive without the attending
pomp and circumstance.</p>

<p>We drove through the old sea-gate at a
gallop and descended pell-mell upon the <em>molo</em>,
our driver walloping his horses through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>crowd with reckless abandon and utter disregard
for human life or limb, for <i>he</i> was curious,
too.</p>

<p>As we came to a jerky halt at the foot of
the gangway we saw that on the steamer’s
deck stood a great, mud-coloured object, which
somewhat resembled in size and contour the
broadside of an elephant. This mastodon,
whatever it might be, was swathed in tarpaulins.</p>

<p>Tackle and planks were being rigged rapidly,
and, at last, the puzzling what-was-it was
skidded to the <em>molo</em> from the deck of the
steamer. The gaping crowd stood breathless
with anticipation while the tarpaulins were
raised, and behold! a motor-omnibus for use
on the road between the steamer piers at Gravosa
and the fashionable hotel in Ragusa.
Wonder of Wonders! The first automobile
to denature with the fumes of gasoline the
virgin atmosphere of lower Dalmatia.</p>

<p>This marvellous machine was the most cumbersome
parcel of freight consigned to Gravosa
and soon the reversed twin screws of the
steamer were churning the placid waters of the
harbour into filmy patches of white froth.
We backed away from the <em>molo</em> and its burden
of inquisitive onlookers, turned about and
headed speedily for the narrow harbour exit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>through which we caught glimpses of the blue
of the Adriatic beyond.</p>

<p>The four hour sea trip from Gravosa to
Cattaro is one replete with scenic surprises,
and the first of these is a magnificent panorama
of Ragusa and her stately fortresses as
we round the rocky promontory just to the
north of the town. Ragusa is inviting enough
from land, but when viewed from the sea it
is fascinating beyond description.</p>

<p>For a distance after passing Ragusa the
coast line is unprotected from the winds and
storms of the Adriatic but, except in early
spring or late fall, little fear of the sudden
rising of a “Bora” or a “Scirocco,” the winds
most dreaded along the Dalmatian coast, need
be felt. On account of the depth of water
the course taken by the steamers is always
within easy sight of the shore, and the mountains
seem to rise directly from the red-tiled
roofs of the village houses.</p>

<p>After the steamer rounds Punta d’Ostro,
with her mediæval castle and modern fortifications
which keep watch for Austria over this
part of her territory, an hour’s ride through
some of the most beautiful scenery is in store
for the traveller, for this promontory marks
the entrance of the famous Bocche di Cattaro,
the most wonderful and best naturally protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
harbour in the world. I should not
say that at this point is the “entrance” to the
Bocche, for the word “Bocche” itself is the
plural of “Boca” and means, literally, “entrances”
or “mouths,” but the term “Bocche
di Cattaro” has been so generally applied to
the basins themselves which, together, make up
the harbour, that it enjoys almost universal
usage.</p>

<p>Of these basins there are three which are of
considerable expanse, resembling small inland
seas: the basins of Castelnuovo, Teodo and
Cattaro. The remaining two, for there are
five in all, are not so extensive and might be
considered as bays leading off from the larger
bodies of water. These latter are joined by
narrow straits or channels, which is not the
case with the smaller bays, like that of Risano.
The narrowest Boca is at the entrance of the
sea of Perasto and is familiarly known as “La
Catene,” because of the fact that at the time
when Lewis of Hungary was defending Cattaro
against the Venetians he sealed up the
entrance to this particular body of water by
stretching a “chain” across the mouth so that
it would be impossible for the caravels of the
enemy to enter.</p>

<p>Lofty, barren peaks rise on every side from
the very shore line, while the water of the harbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
is peacefully calm, translucent and, in
colour, a deep blue, rendered deeper by the
dark shadows of the overhanging mountains.
Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the ancient historian
of the country, probably stretched the
time limit an hour or two when he said that
the sun never penetrated the Bocche di Cattaro
except in summer, but, nevertheless, it has
been proven a fact that in the course of a winter’s
day Cattaro enjoys but five hours of sunlight,
so hemmed in is it between the tall mountain
peaks and ranges.</p>

<p>The picturesque little town of Castelnuovo
lies directly across the bay from the Punto
d’Ostro. In front of the town the steamer
stops long enough for a few fussy Dalmatian
women to climb down the ship’s accommodation
ladder to the boats, which have put out
from shore to take off any passengers or
freight the steamer may be carrying consigned
to Castelnuovo.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_205"><img src="images/i_205.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="360" /></a>
<p class="caption">A GENERAL VIEW OF CASTELNUOVO.</p>
</div>

<p>Steaming onward toward Cattaro we pass
two small islets, each of which seems barely
large enough to keep the little churches and
gardens which they hold on their surfaces from
sliding into the bay. Upon one of them stands
the monastery of San Giorgio, strikingly diminutive
and quaint, but complete from bell-tower
to cloister; on the other island is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>chapel of Santa Maria della Scarpello, containing
a portrait of the Madonna said to have
been painted by none other than St. Luke.</p>

<p>As we enter the bay of Cattaro, after turning
abruptly around the foot of a cliff, the
view is one of beauty beyond adequate description.
Ahead, at the farther end of the bay,
the town of Cattaro clings like a vegetable
parasite to the steep base of the majestic
mountain. Above it the famous “Ladder,”
the trail used by the Montenegrins for five
hundred years to descend from their mountain
homes to Cattaro on market-days, scales the
face of Mount Lovčen (pronounced Lovtchen);
higher up, and a little to the right,
may be seen the white zig-zags of the wonderful
wagon road to Cettinje, the smallest and
most inaccessible capital in Europe.</p>

<p>But distance lends enchantment to Cattaro,
and the most favourable impressions of the
town may be had from the deck of the steamer.
Once having set foot on the stone quay the
place seems to have lost its individuality, and
reminds one of any other town which has huddled
itself together under the dominating influences
of the Venetians. You might think
that the houses had been thrown upon each
other in a heap, and when someone wished to
move about the town he dug a path between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>them as he needed it. The streets, if such they
may be called, are little more than passageways
between the walls of the houses. The
hotels are dirty and offer the poorest excuses
for accommodations to be found in the Balkans.</p>

<p>On Saturdays the Montenegrins from the
mountains climb down the “Ladder” to the
market in Cattaro, first being compelled to
leave their weapons in the custody of an Austrian
official outside the city gates. In the
evening they climb wearily back to their homes,
with nothing to look forward to but the market
on the following Saturday.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the unattractiveness of the
town, there are two very patent reasons for
visiting Cattaro. One is, that the delightfulness
of the boat trip through the Bocche, with
its magnificent scenery, far excels anything
of the sort to be had south of Norway or north
of the Straits of Magellan, and the other, that
the drive over the Black Mountains to Cettinje
unveils to the traveller some of the most
wonderful views to be had in Europe. Indeed,
it is said that the panorama of the Bocche
and the Adriatic from the cloud-encircled summit
of the mountain cannot be surpassed in the
whole world.</p>

I&mdash;The Family of Petrovich&mdash;Prince Nikola&mdash;The

Montenegro of To-day.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A</span> mere niche in the mountain wall of south-eastern
Europe, with the blue rollers of the
Adriatic pounding relentlessly against its
meagre coast line and hemmed in on the remaining
three sides by nominal provinces of
hostile Turkey, lies Montenegro, the Gibraltar
of the Balkan Peninsula. Notwithstanding
the fact that it is the smallest of the free
Balkan states, its total area covering but three
thousand five hundred square miles, half the
size of Wales and but three times as large as
the state of Rhode Island, with an estimated
population less than that of the single city of
Buffalo, Montenegro remains as yet unconquered.
For five hundred years its handful
of patriots have withstood successfully the onslaughts
of the hordes of Turks, fighting for
every inch of rocky territory that was finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>ceded to them by the Powers of Europe in
1878.</p>

<p>The history of Montenegro begins at the
time of the Turkish victory over the Servians
at Kossovo, June 28, 1389. It is a history
of nothing but war because, on account of
their surroundings, the Montenegrins have had
nothing to do with commerce and the arts of
peace. Indeed, it was, and is yet, except in
a few fertile valleys, almost a geographical
impossibility for them to cultivate the soil, and
the Turks, in their ferocious attempts to subjugate
the eastern half of Europe, harassed
the Montenegrins so continually on all sides
that there was little else to think of but war.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_213"><img src="images/i_213.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption">A GROUP OF MONTENEGRINS.</p>
</div>

<p>To delve briefly into the beginning of
things, this Land of the Black Mountain was
settled by a dauntless band of Servian refugees
who, after the battle of Kossovo, when
Tzar Lazar, Emperor of Servia, was defeated
by the Turks, preferred liberty in some wild
country of their own at any price, rather than
live under the domination of the Mohammedans.
They fled, accordingly, into the Black
Mountains and there commenced the story of
the Montenegrins and their strenuous existence.
This story has been written in the blood
of the Ottoman, but never once during the five
hundred years of almost continuous war that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>followed did Turkey gain a permanent foothold
in Montenegro.</p>

<p>Strange to say, even at the present writing,
Montenegro does not maintain what would
be called in military vernacular a “standing
army.” The “regulars” comprise two companies
of thirty-two men each, each company
taking its turn in guarding the palace and
acting in the capacity of secret service sleuths
for the Prince. But the spirit of patriotism
within the breast of every Montenegrin demands
that he stand ready to defend his country
to-day, as he has done in the past. Except
for those of the guards who peer out from the
open doorways of the little peppermint sentry-boxes
outside the Prince’s palace, a military
uniform is a rare sight in Cettinje, the miniature
capital.</p>

<p>In a country like Montenegro, guerilla warfare
is the best possible method of defence, and
to it the Montenegrins are particularly well
adapted. To the mountainous nature of their
land is partly due the many decisive victories
which they have gained over the Turks, who
have sent army after army of from forty thousand
to two hundred thousand men against
the stubborn little band of fighters. Another
point in their favour is the rapidity with which
their forces may be mobilized. On one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in 1887, six thousand men were assembled
on the Austrian frontier, between eight
o’clock in the evening and four the following
morning. Doubtless, even to-day, the whole
available Montenegrin military force of more
than forty-two thousand men might be strung
along the frontier within four or five days at
the most.</p>

<p>It seems stretching it a point or two to say
that eight thousand men would be able under
any circumstances to put to flight an army of
sixty thousand, but such was the case in 1604
when a comparatively small band of Montenegrins
defeated almost seven and one-half times
their number of Turks. In 1796, under
Peter I, at Kroussa, the Turks received their
most crushing defeat. Thirty thousand of
them were slain and the Montenegrin leader
himself killed Kara Mahmoud, the Turkish
general, and spitted his head on his sword.
This mountain warrior was of a family which
has ruled in the land for two hundred years
and was an antecedent of the reigning Prince.</p>

<p>In those days the leader was called a “Vladika,”
or Prince-Bishop, who combined both
spiritual and temporal power. This Bishop
being celibate the office passed from uncle to
nephew until 1852 when an absolute principality
was established, to be ruled over by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>hereditary Princes with unconditional autocratic
power.</p>

<p>Prince Nikola, the present ruler, the seventh
of the family of Petrovich of Njegushi who has
governed Montenegro, succeeded to the title
in 1860, after the assassination of his unpopular
uncle, Danilo II. Nikola is now almost
seventy years of age, but tall, erect and deep-chested,
and carries his years as becomes the
fighter and leader he has been. He received
his education in Paris and in Trieste, and is
gifted with no ordinary literary talents, having
written many poems commemorating the
victories of the Montenegrins over the Turks,
in addition to two plays, “The Empress of
the Balkans” and “Prince Arbanit,” which
still enjoy occasional runs behind the kerosene
footlights on the exiguous stage of the little
theatre in Cettinje. His civil list amounts to
but $25,000, and it means a strain on his revenues
to supply his two elder sons with $6,000
a year each.</p>

<p>Her Majesty, Queen Helena of Italy, who
so endeared herself to the hearts of her subjects
at the scenes of the recent earthquake in
Sicily, is the most illustrious of Prince Nikola’s
nine children. She was born in the palace
at Cettinje in 1872 and was brought up in the
strictest economy, according to the traditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>of the family of Petrovich. She was a girl
of “God’s out-of-doors,” and the episodes of
her early life taught her the trails of the Black
Mountain and whither they led. It is said she
could handle a rifle as well as any of her three
brothers. She was also a favourite of her relative,
Alexander of Russia, and through his
liberality was taken to St. Petersburg and
educated. The heir to the throne of Italy met
her later in Venice, fell ardently in love with
her and they were married on October 4, 1896.</p>

<p>When at home the Prince wears his national
dress consisting of a small, round cap (<i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">kapitza</i>)
embroidered in gold on the top with
the letters “N. I.”; a long white, or light
blue, cloak of broadcloth (<i lang="az" xml:lang="az">dolama</i> or <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">gunj</i>),
circled at the waist by a fancy girdle, in the
front of which nestles a formidable array of
cumbersome firearms; a red waist-coat (<em>jalek</em>);
a short, richly embroidered Zouave
jacket (<em>jamada</em>); loose, blue knickerbockers
(<em>shalwar</em>); sandals (<em>opanka</em>); and carries
across his shoulder a dark-coloured plaid shawl
with heavy fringe (<em>struka</em>). That he makes
himself popular goes without question, for it
is said that he knows personally every citizen
in Cettinje and will call each by name when
the occasion arises.</p>

<p class="caption">A TYPICAL MONTENEGRIN GIRL.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1861-62 Nikola meted out to the invading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> Turks
a noteworthy defeat. Again in
1877-78 he defeated ninety thousand Turks,
with a much inferior number of Montenegrins,
and drove them from the country, killing and
wounding twelve thousand.</p>

<p>Many interesting anecdotes are told of the
daring and bravery of the Montenegrins in
their struggles to save their country from the
covetous grasp of the Mohammedans. Only a
band of men driven to desperation in almost
inaccessible mountain regions could possibly
withstand so many attacks of such overwhelming
odds as were hurled against them. In one
famous battle at Kristatz a small band of two
thousand engaged thirty thousand Turks
under Suleiman Pasha, inflicting a loss of
three thousand five hundred upon the enemy,
while the number of their own dead totalled
but seven hundred. On another occasion at
Jezero the Montenegrins killed four hundred
and eighty Turks, sustaining a loss of but
thirty-six killed and wounded.</p>

<p>During this latter engagement a powerful
mountaineer of the clan of Paperi, having distinguished
himself at the battle of Vucidol by
capturing Osman Pasha, the Turkish general,
and carrying him to Prince Nikola, being presented
with five hundred ducats for his captive,
was jokingly bade by the Prince to fetch him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>another Turk. The hero, however, took the
matter seriously and, at an opportune moment,
rushed into the Turkish lines, snatched a devout
Mohammedan around the waist, disarmed
him and started to carry him off toward
the rear, where Prince Nikola was watching
the fight. In order to arrive at the side of
his sovereign he was compelled to make a
détour, and before he had covered half the distance
he was brought down with a bullet in
his thigh. Naturally, he dropped his Ottoman
captive, and the latter immediately sprang at
his throat. With almost superhuman efforts,
in spite of the excruciating pain of his wound,
he held off the vengeful Turk with one hand
and, aiming his pistol with the other, ordered
his adversary to lift him on his back and <em>carry
him</em> to the Prince. To disobey meant instant
death, for the cold, circular muzzle of a huge
weapon was even then so close to his fez that
he could plainly see the rifling in the barrel.
Stumbling and groaning under the weight of
his Montenegrin rider the Turk approached
the Prince, while the hills resounded with the
cheers of the men of the clan of Paperi. Upon
delivering his steed to his leader the soldier fell
to the ground senseless from exhaustion and
loss of blood.</p>

<p>While this same battle was at its height the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>Prince approached a mountaineer of more
than eighty years of age, who was bravely
endeavouring to keep his place among his fellows
but with evident difficulty, and suggested
to him sympathetically that he was too old to
follow the flag and had better withdraw. The
veteran, being thus considered by his military
idol as unable longer to fight for his country,
forthwith drew his pistol and committed suicide.</p>

<p>It was at the siege of Nikshitch that the
valorous warrior-priest of the Montenegrins,
Pope Milo, challenged any Turk to personal
combat between the lines with broadswords.
Both armies ceased the fight while the battle-royal
was in progress. The Turk, however,
proved the better swordsman and killed his
antagonist, severing the head from the body.
Upon the resumption of hostilities an infuriated
Montenegrin revenged the death of Pope
Milo by dealing with the same Turk in a similar
manner.</p>

<p>Prince Nikola himself was in command at
the siege of Nikshitch, in which the Montenegrin
women were little less active than the
men, for they carried ammunition and food
across the mountains and otherwise assisted in
the Montenegrin victory. The Prince, reclining
upon a rock, over which he had first spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>his <em>struka</em>, received the surrender of Scanderbeg
and invited the Turkish commander to
take coffee with him. Coffee over, he wrote
a poem of the siege and forwarded it by messenger
to his wife in Cettinje. She read it
aloud to the citizens gathered together in the
public square.</p>

<p>But fighting as one nation against another
has not been the only form of warfare indulged
in by the Montenegrins. During the
brief intervals of Turkish lethargy blood-feuds
between the families of the mountaineers
afforded the male members plenty of diversion.
They had no cause to complain of monotonous
inactivity. A boy might grow to
manhood in blissful ignorance that it would
be his duty sooner or later to take the life of
another, thus avenging the untimely death of
one of the members of his own family. Upon
the successful accomplishment of his mission,
as was usually the case, he, in turn, would be
thereafter considered as a target for the
weapon of some member of the rival family.
Thus the feuds were continuous, imperishable
heirlooms handed down from father to son,
even unto the third and fourth generation.</p>

<p>By the Treaty of Berlin, Montenegro acquired
twenty-five miles of seacoast adjoining
Albania; the bulk of her trade, however, continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to come and go through the Dalmatian
port of Cattaro, a port upon which these people
of the mountains have ever cast a covetous
glance, but from which they are shut out by
the great rocky barriers of the Dinaric Alps.</p>

<p>Railway building in Montenegro is very
difficult, and as yet the principality is without
means of transportation other than by wagon
train and a few small steamers which ply on
the Lake of Scutari. The project is now on
foot to build a railway from Antivari, on the
coast, to Virbazaar, a short distance inland.</p>

<p>Podgoritza, situated in a part of the territory
acquired in 1878, is a town of eleven thousand
inhabitants, the largest in Montenegro,
and is the centre of trade. Hard by are the
ruins of the Roman city of Docle, the birthplace
of Diocletian. Excellent tobacco, for
which the district is famous, is grown in the
vicinity of the great Lake of Scutari, half of
which stretches over into Albania. The annual
imports of the country are valued at
about $1,375,000, while the exports, consisting
mainly of tobacco, dried meats, hides and
fish, are valued at $1,040,000.</p>

<p>A few years ago the Montenegrins shouted
from hill to hill the news of the country, and
in these regions the human voice is said to
carry exceptionally long distances. The news
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>of the defeat of the Russians at the Alma was
“holloed” by the shepherds from mountain to
mountain across the Balkan Peninsula, and in
a marvellously short time the tidings reached
the Dalmatian coast. To-day, telegraph
wires are stretched across the Black Mountains,
connecting almost all of the towns; the
seaport of Antivari boasting even of a Marconi
wireless station, which places Montenegro
in direct communication with the coast of
Italy.</p>

Capital&mdash;Historical Monuments in Cettinje&mdash;The Return
to Cattaro.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> takes nine hours to drive the twenty-eight
miles and a quarter across the mountains
from Cattaro to Cettinje, the miniature capital
of this miniature principality. Because of
the time consumed in the drive it does not follow
that the going is rough. On the contrary,
the road is of the best, for, as far as the Montenegrin
frontier, it was built with infinite
care by the Austrian government in order to
facilitate the passage of troops and field
pieces, should the occasion arise. The mountain
gorges are bridged with stone arches,
their foundations being imbedded in the rocks
many feet below the roadway, while along the
outer side of the latter stretches a continuous
protecting wall of cut rock, cemented, of a
yard in height. The road itself is smooth and
free from stones, but the white, powdery dust
sifts into your hair and through every stitch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>of your clothing. If Cattaro, the
starting-point of the trip across the mountains, were
not sealed up in such an out-of-the-way corner
of the continent, touring motorists, doubtless,
would be more familiar with the topography
of Montenegro. As it is, there have been up-to-date
but two or three automobiles to cross
the face of the mountains on the way to Cettinje,
and the distinction of driving these
machines lies at the thresholds of Americans.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Cattaro the road skirts the
harbour for a short distance, winds around
toward the hills through avenues of stately
poplars, crosses a little bridge which spans the
Gordicchio, makes several zig-zags, and then
sweeps widely toward the south&mdash;you really
seem to be driving away from the mountain
which you must scale later&mdash;in full view of
the Adriatic, while the bay, or Bocche di Cattaro,
is lost to view behind you. At the top
of the pass leading to the town of Budua, the
outlook over the broad, fertile plain of Garbalj,
with the sea in the distance, is very impressive.
For a short distance the highway,
as it winds around the face of the cliff, literally
overhangs the plain and then turns abruptly
toward the Black Mountain. In the distance
the white, zig-zagging road, surmounting the
almost perpendicular wall of rock ahead, looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>like a thread on the shoulder of a giant, and
causes you to wonder that it took no more than
twenty years to build.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_231"><img src="images/i_231.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="550" /></a>
<p class="caption">A SECTION OF THE ROAD ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS.</p>
</div>

<p>This being the shortest and easiest route for
trade between the outside world and the Montenegrin
capital, quantities of provisions,
household furniture, lumber and other materials
for building purposes, and what not are
freighted by four, five and six-horse teams
over these twenty-eight miles of mountains,
from Cattaro to Cettinje. There is also a passenger
stage that operates daily between the
two towns.</p>

<p>We had passed the little stone half-way
house, which is stuck on the face of the rock
at one of the very acute angles of the winding
road overlooking the Bocche, when we came
upon one of these freight caravans plugging
laboriously along, with the hope of making
Cettinje sometime the following day. One
of the wagons was loaded with kegs of beer,
and it was all too evident that the several
treacherous looking drivers in the party had
been indulging their thirst from time to time,
to the appreciable loss to the person to whom
the kegs were consigned. As we approached,
our driver stopped his nondescript team and
had a few confiding words with the freighters.
Together they succeeded in puncturing one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>the kegs with a long wire nail; then a horse
bucket was cut from its swinging position
under one of the wagons. This was rinsed out
with a goodly supply of beer tapped from the
punctured cask, and refilled, to moisten the
already well-lubricated throats of all concerned.
How many full casks reached their
destination after several days spent on the
road would make a nice problem for a class in
algebra. If the freighters met many drivers
as thirsty as ours it is a question whether or
not it would have been best for them to have
appeared in Cettinje at all.</p>

<p>At each successive turn of the road a more
wonderful panorama of the Bocche stretches
out before you, and, after more than three
hours of steady climbing, the pass at the top
of the mountains is reached, and you cross the
frontier, marked by a single stone post at the
side of the roadway.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_235"><img src="images/i_235.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="354" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE PASS AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS.</p>
</div>

<p>The view of the Montenegrin side of the
mountains can only be described as purely
“Montenegrin.” The Bocche is, of course,
lost to view and you have before you nothing
but what seems to be a gigantic upheaval of
rocks. Not a tree, not a shrub, not even a
dust-covered sprout at the side of the road,
relieves the sameness of this picture of gray
desolation. Perhaps, if you look closely, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>will partly be able to distinguish, less than a
hundred yards away, a native mountaineer
whose very garb is of protective colouring,
concealing him almost entirely from your notice
against the background of bare stones.</p>

<p>From the top of the mountain the road descends
to the village of Njegushi, the birthplace
of His Ferocity, Prince Nikola. But
were it not for the red-tiled roofs there would
be, from a distance, no circumstantial evidence
whatever that the town exists, for the houses
are all of stone of the same hue as the surrounding
mountains.</p>

<p>While you sup on the stone porch of the
little inn at Njegushi, handsome, well-built
members of the male population stroll by indifferently,
smoking and chatting in subdued
tones and gazing dreamily at their beloved
mountains. From every girdle protrude the
muzzles of a number of well-oiled, ominous-looking
firearms. Groups of women stumble
by; some struggling under their loads of
water casks strapped upon their backs, others
driving small herds of goats and having all
manner of difficulty in keeping them together.</p>

<p>Yes, the women are ultra-suffragettes in
Montenegro, not by choice but by custom.
They do all the housework, tend the flocks, cultivate
the little patches of corn or wheat and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>in addition, bring up the family. On
market-days they go to Cattaro or Cettinje and do
their best to dispose of a meagre assortment
of vegetable truck, returning home late at
night, weary and sore. They age early, as
might be expected; a Montenegrin woman of
forty looks to be double that age. Not a
finger will a man raise to ease the burden of
his wife; for such is the lot of a woman born
in the Land of the Black Mountain.</p>

<p>From the hills above Njegushi you may
look down into small, crater-like pits, each
held intact by a low stone wall. These pits
constitute the truck farms of Montenegro, and
into them the rain washes all the vegetable
earth from the mountain sides, forming in
them an alluvial stratum.</p>

<p>After leaving Njegushi you ascend to the
pass of Kruacko Zdrjelo, and, at this point,
another wonderful view unfolds itself. Away
to the south, the great lake of Scutari is
plainly visible; in the west, the famous Mount
Lovčen rears its rocky self, with the little
chapel, in which lies buried the body of Peter
II, the last of the Prince-Bishops and Montenegro’s
greatest poet, perched upon its crest.</p>

<p>Doubtless, night will by this time have
spread its black mantle over the hills, leaving
the remainder of the drive to be made in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>darkness. Down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;as much
down as the Austrian side of the mountain
was up, until finally, you overlook the beautiful
valley of Cettinje, and the blinking kerosene
lamps of the capital. In half an hour
you will be driving at a gallop through its
deserted streets, and rein up at last in front of
the Grand Hotel, obviously the most aristocratic
and up-to-date hostelry, for it is the only
one in the town. The head-waiter, in dress
suit, will welcome you at the door, inquire
whether you have had supper and show you
politely to your rooms, which you will find
rather bare but scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago Cettinje was a mere handful
of thatched cottages scattered over a small
space in the valley and approached only by
mountain trails. To-day it has a population
of five or six thousand, it is the seat of the
newly constituted Parliament and a diplomatic
post for the ministers of the European
Powers.</p>

<p>There are but few historical monuments in
Cettinje, and of these the principal ones are
the old palace of the Prince, and the monastery
with its chapel and quaint cloister, the
latter built against the base of a great cliff and
shaded by the spreading boughs of shapely
trees. The main street of the town is wide and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>clean, flanked on either side by a uniform line
of stone dwellings, which is broken only by the
postoffice building and an occasional shop.</p>

<p>As in Njegushi, the men, all heavily armed,
strut along the streets and allow the women-folk
to conduct what business may be found
in the stores or in the market. At the rear of
the hotel a rather barren-looking square to deserve
the nomenclature of “park” faces the
palace of the Crown Prince. Near the centre
of the town stands the palace of Prince Nikola,
a comparatively small and a most unimposing
structure to house the chief executive of a
nation. Directly across the street from it is
his former residence, in which is installed the
only billiard table in Montenegro.</p>

<p>The most elaborate example of architecture
in the capital is the home of the Russian diplomatic
representatives, probably so built to
impress the Montenegrins with the power of
their cousins in the north. In the centre of
the market square the female figure which surmounts
the public fountain, the sole specimen
of native sculpture in Cettinje, balances, at an
uncertain angle, upon her head a dilapidated
coal-oil lamp, which seems in imminent danger
of being dashed upon the heads of the thirsty
peasants below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_241"><img src="images/i_241.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="359" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE MAIN STREET, CETTINJE.</p>
</div>

<p>The body of Peter I reposes peacefully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>after his many years of active leadership, in
its sarcophagus in the little chapel of the monastery,
while at the opposite end of the village
a small arsenal contains the sum total of Montenegrin
pieces of ordnance. One room is devoted
to the trophies of war taken from the
Turks, including swords, bullet-riddled flags
and standards, Turkish field pieces and personal
insignia.</p>

<p>A prolonged stay is not necessary to see all
there is to be seen in the miniature capital,
three or four days being quite sufficient. On
the height of the first ascent after leaving the
town a glorious view of the valley below, all
divided off into the little stone-encircled fields,
may be had. As you journey on, you may
pass a group or two of gypsies or a hermit-peasant
who hobbles out of his thatched hut to
beg a handful of tobacco. At last you break
through the pass at the top of the mountains
in full view of the Bocche di Cattaro.</p>

<p>A diminutive white steamer leaving the
<em>molo</em> of the town almost directly under you,
moves slowly toward the narrow exit to the
Adriatic, its propellers churning a fan-shaped
wake of foam which loses itself finally in the
broad expanse of placid water.</p>

<p>The sunset from the heights, as it illumines
the lower mountain ranges with an old-rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>sheen and diffuses its tinted rays across the
Bocche and the broad Adriatic beyond, is gorgeous
enough to baffle description. A painter
who could picture truthfully that evening panorama
might well consider it his masterpiece.
The silence of the mountains is unbroken, save
for the melancholy pipings of a lone shepherd
boy hidden somewhere among the rocks in the
distance. The silence of the sky and the
silence of the rock-walled Bocche “mingle in
an awful spell that falls upon the soul like the
lonesomeness of the grave. There is something
of death in life and of life in death in the
grim inevitableness of this silence, so changeless
and yet so vital.” The sunset above and
the yawning cañon-like pit below “grip the
soul and draw it to a communion with something
strong outside itself&mdash;something that
escapes definition and analysis; something
that the ancient people meant when they said
that they walked with God.”</p>

<p>For a long time you will stop and drink in
eagerly the splendour of the scene, and then,
reluctantly, yet as if influenced by the magnetism
of the abyss, commence to descend the
windings, one after another, back to the quaint
little Dalmatian port of Cattaro.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="center">SPALATO AND SALONA</p>


<p class="hang50">Westward Along the Coast&mdash;First Glimpse of Spalato&mdash;The
Campanile&mdash;Diocletian’s Palace&mdash;Salona and Her Ruins.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> full glow of the morning sunlight
gleamed and danced upon the brass-work of
the little steamer <em>Petka</em> as the stevedores finished
their loading of her freight from the
dock at Cattaro and the last assortment of
passengers had wobbled noisily up the gangway.</p>

<p>It was exactly ten o’clock when the lines
were cast off and the ship steamed slowly
ahead, turning on her course to gain the Adriatic.
She circled about almost at the very
edge of the shore line, for there is no semblance
of a beach and the deep water extends to the
bases of the mighty cliffs that surround the
harbour, until Cattaro in the distance put one
in mind of a collection of Noah’s Ark houses.
The waters were calm and smooth as the surface
of a mirror, and held quiescent and in
perfect outline the reflections of the rugged
mountains.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>
<p>Once the <em>Petka</em> had negotiated the many
consecutive mouths of the Bocche and had
finally passed the grim walls of the fortresses
on Punta d’Ostro, close on the starboard, she
set her course almost due west with her ultimate
destination Fiume, her home port; but
she was due to call <em>en voyage</em> at almost all of
the towns along the coast.</p>

<p>Her main deck was an odd and interesting
sight. It was crowded, so crowded that one
could see scarcely one square inch of planking,
with a rare galaxy of Montenegrins, Cattarines,
Albanians, Greeks and Austrian soldiers,
each garbed in some bit of costume that
made his or her nationality unmistakable. All
sprawled about in the sun, smoking or sleeping,
their heads and shoulders entwined about
their luggage and their legs aimed across the
deck like the tails of so many comets.</p>

<p>Above the upper deck, reserved for first-class
passengers, white awnings had been
stretched, and under these we followed the
examples of the natives on board, to a certain
extent, to enjoy the beauties of the land-locked
passage, through which the ship set her course
after leaving Gravosa.</p>

<p>Here on deck, lunch was served at noon and
dinner in the evening, each meal an elaborate
affair with wine, and composed of some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>most palatable dishes to be had anywhere in
Europe. Seven constitutes the usual number
of courses served at dinner on board any of
these Adriatic coasters, and lunch is hardly
less voluminous: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors-d’œuvres</i>, of course;
soup; fish; a sort of cold fish salad with mayonnaise;
spring lamb and delicious vegetables;
game of some description; salad; and dessert.</p>

<p>And just to offer one more probative demonstration
of how puny the world really is,
the chief officer of the <em>Petka</em> had been for
many years in the service of a trans-Pacific
steamship company, and, during that time,
had lived in Santa Clara, California. There
his three children had been born, and their
father assisted in their education by teaching
each one to speak five languages in addition to
English.</p>

<p>Almost the entire distance from Gravosa to
Fiume the course of the steamers lies along
an inland passage protected from the sea-swells
of the Adriatic by hundreds of islands,
some large and some small, but all of a considerable
height, while, from the shores of the
mainland, the mountains rise with such apparent
verticality that it would seem a simple
matter to stand at any point along the top
and drop a plumb line to the water below.
No matter what moment you might gaze up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>or down the coast or seaward you would be
able to see from five to thirty-five islands,
without half trying. The water is all of such
great depth, even to the edge of the coast, that
it is said a vessel might pass safely between
two protruding rocks situated so close together
as to barely admit of the ship’s passage.
The conspicuous absence of lights to warn the
mariner at night makes navigation seem difficult
and dangerous, but the pilots know the
channels as they know their rosaries. Neither
are the ships supplied with searchlights to
facilitate the picking out of the few buoys that
mark the channels farther along. One or two
of the particularly narrow places of the course,
however, are marked by miniature light-houses,
not more than ten feet in height, which
stick up from the water to indicate the base
of a wall of rock as it juts out into the blackness
of the night.</p>

<p>About fifty miles from Ragusa, in the narrow
channel which divides the Sabbioncello
Peninsula from the island of Curzola, a
famous sea battle between the Venetians and
the Genoese took place. This affray was won
by the latter, who captured the distinguished
Venetian navigator, Marco Polo, he having
just returned from a cruise in the China Seas.
Polo was taken to Genoa and placed in a dungeon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
where he laboured over the manuscript
of his widely read book of travels. Doge
Dandolo, the Venetian ruler and the admiral
of the fleet, was also captured and borne away
a prisoner of war by the Genoese, but while
<em>en route</em> he dashed out his brains against the
bulwarks of the galley upon which he was
confined.</p>

<p>Just south of Spalato, twenty hours’ ride
from Cattaro by this slow steamer, you will
pass the island of Solta, where is gathered the
honey, world-famed for its excellence, sucked
from the blooms of the rosemary and the cistus
rose.</p>

<p>The object that will first attract your attention
upon entering the harbour of Spalato is
the tall campanile, always in repair, and
around which the hideous scaffolding has been
allowed to remain since 1882, and it will
probably remain for some time to come; for
the repairs to the tower are so slow in progressing
that as soon as one job is finished another
presents itself. The building of this
campanile was begun by Maria of Hungary
about 1300, but her death in 1323 caused an
interruption to the work. It was not again
taken up until 1360, when Elizabeth the Elder,
sent by her son Lewis of Hungary to govern
Dalmatia, ordered that the work be carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>out under the supervision of the Spalatine
architect, Nicolas Tverdoj. The tower was
completed in 1416, but it was not so substantially
built as it might have been&mdash;for we
are told that the subtle art of “graft” had
made itself felt in Dalmatia even at that
date&mdash;and as early as 1472 an architect,
Nicolo Fiorentino, commenced the repairs
which have continued to this day and which,
from all appearances, promise to continue until
the campanile is a ruin.</p>

<p>From the top of the scaffold, after a somewhat
tiresome climb, one can obtain a comprehensive
and beautiful panoramic view of Spalato,
where lived and died the composer
Von Suppe, and also of the harbour.</p>

<p>Aside from the quaintly dressed Dalmatian
fisher folk, who patch and re-patch the variegated
sails of their tiny craft along the stone
quay, the town is interesting from the fact that
it contains the best example of Roman domestic
architecture to be found anywhere in the
world, not excepting the magnificent ruins of
Pompeii and Herculaneum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_253"><img src="images/i_253.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="354" /></a>
<p class="caption">SPALATO FROM THE CAMPANILE.</p>
</div>

<p>The subject of this rather broad, but nevertheless
true, statement is the old palace built
by Diocletian at the beginning of the fourth
century, and in which the Roman ex-Emperor
took up his abode after his abdication and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>where he lived until his death in 313, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> Its
building marked the date of a new departure
in architecture; a departure which ended in
the development of the Byzantine and the
Romanesque art of modern Europe, they having
been inaugurated by modifying the rules
of the ancients.</p>

<p>To this favoured spot on the coast near the
then powerful Illyrian metropolis of Salona
came Diocletian, and here he built his imperial
villa, where he hoped to live peacefully for the
remainder of his days. And what a wonderful
villa it must have been!</p>

<p>Its walls were from five hundred and seventy
to seven hundred feet in length, fifty feet
in height, and encompassed nine and one-half
acres of ground. The eminent English architect,
Adam, who, in 1757, accomplished the
difficult and arduous task of plotting the first
plans of the ruined palace on paper with no
previous mathematical data to guide him, said
that it was “a climax in architecture.” So
much of its original splendour did it retain
that the imperial Roman historian avowed
that “it surpassed even in its ruin all powers
of description;” and that was more than six
centuries after Diocletian’s death.</p>

<p>On the south side, facing the sea, the walls
were seventy feet in height, because of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>sloping of the land. The outline of this stone-work
was broken by a grand total of sixteen
towers, only four of which, those on the corners,
were higher&mdash;and that only by a few
feet&mdash;than the walls themselves. There were
four entrance gates to the palace and three of
these can still be distinguished.</p>

<p>If you could have entered the north gate of
the palace at a time when its builder and owner
was ripening in years within its precincts, you
would have looked down on a street thirty-six
feet in width. On either side, graceful stone
arcades dwindled into the perspective and at
the farther end of the street the view was interrupted
by the massive portico and dome of
the vestibule to the imperial residence. At a
point three hundred feet south of this gate,
where you would have stood, the lines of
arcades were exchanged for the beautiful
columns of a peristyle, on either side of which
were enclosed courts, that to the right containing
the temple of Æsculapius and that to the
left, the temple of Jupiter.</p>

<p>Near the peristyle, a street, also fringed
with arcades, crossed from west to east, having
its termini at the Porta Ferrea and the Porta
Ænea respectively. To the south of the vestibule
the nave of the palace, ninety-eight feet
long and forty-five feet wide, lined with rows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>of columns and an aisle fourteen feet in width
on either side, extended from west to east.
Mosaics and multi-coloured marbles made up
the decorations of the interior of the apartments,
and the beauty of the courts was enhanced
by the flowers and plants of this latitude.</p>

<p>From the peristyle, the columns of which
were of Cipallino and rose-coloured granite,
flights of steps led to the temples at the sides.
The Temple of Jupiter, which originally
stood apart in a walled court having the peristyle
as a screen in front, was built by Diocletian
as a prospective tomb in which he intended
his body to be placed after death, but
now the building serves as the Duomo of
Spalato. Originally it had a projecting
portico of its own in front, but this has
been replaced by the campanile of the
Duomo. The other of the two temples, that
of Æsculapius, does duty to-day as the city’s
baptistry.</p>

<p>Much of the walls of the palace remain to-day,
and shut in the old town of Spalato built
within the enclosure by the refugees from
Salona. Outside of these moss-grown, inarticulate
historians of Roman occupation you
will find modern European dwellings, school-houses
and shady little parks, and at places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>even on the top of the walls some sacrilegious
Spalatines have built their more humble
abodes. The peristyle of the famous palace
now forms the town square.</p>

<p>After you have made many conjectures as to
what a residence the palace of Diocletian must
have been, and what scenes were pictured
there in the days when its builder made it his
home, you will walk outside the walls of the
old city, which you must do in order to find a
carriage, for horses are not permitted within
the gates on account of the narrowness of the
streets, and bargain with a <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">cocher</i> to take you
to Salona.</p>

<p>On the way you will pass a wonderful
ruined aqueduct, which Diocletian built to
supply his palace with water from the hills,
and which has now been restored to the same
use by the modern Spalatines. The road first
rises to the top of a ridge and then stretches
across the valley of the Riviera dei Castelli
which extends from Salona to Traü, the ancient
Tragurium of the Romans, famed for
its marble, and colonized originally in
380, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, by Syracusan Greeks from the
island of Lissa. The road is so dusty that the
vegetation growing along the side is completely
covered with the fine white powder;
but the drive is not long and your visit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Salona will be sure to repay you fully for any
slight discomforts endured on the way.</p>

<p class="caption">A FOUNTAIN ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SPALATO.</p>
</div>

<p>Salona is situated among the foot-hills of
the Cabani Mountains on the shores of an inland
sea which is shut off from the Adriatic by
the island of Bua. That information-breathing
emperor and historian, Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
said that Salona was at one
time half as large as Constantinople. But no
matter whether it were large or small it is
worthy of a brief description for, if I may
make use of a rather inelegant expression in
order to better convey to the reader some idea
of its antiquity, “Salona was Salona when
Spalato was a pup.”</p>

<p>Founded by Illyrian fugitives from the capital,
Delminium, after the latter’s destruction
by the Romans during the second Dalmatian
war, Salona was taken in 117 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> by Cæcilius
Metellus and made a Roman colony. The
city was long and narrow and divided into
halves by a sort of diaphragm wall, in the middle
point of which was an arched portal called
Cæsar’s Gate. Through the central arch of
this gate the Roman chariots passed and, although
the arches themselves have tumbled
you may, as in Pompeii, still see the grooves
and ruts in the stone pavement worn deep by
the passage of many wheels. A smaller arch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>on either side allowed for the accommodation
of pedestrians. The large Christian basilica,
partly excavated in 1880, was demolished in
639 during the final destruction of the city by
the Avars. A circular baptistry, with its
columned portico facing the south and which
marked the entrance, stood within the walls
in the eastern part of the city. In the centre
of this building, under the dome and sunk in
the floor, was a marble fount for baptism by
immersion, and from its level arose a complete
circle of marble steps; at the top, an aisle with
columns on either side passed around the interior
of the building.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_263"><img src="images/i_263.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="355" /></a>
<p class="caption">THE RUINS OF THE BASILICA, SALONA.</p>
</div>

<p>At the western end of the city can be seen
the ruins of the large amphitheatre, and it is
probable that this was the only building which
survived the devastating fire of the Avars. At
different points along the circuit of the walls,
which had been battered down time and again
and repaired as often, stood no less than
eighty-eight towers, having been constructed
to reinforce the stone-work. The remains of
forty-three of these towers are plainly visible.
By scraping away the dust with the toe of
your shoe, ornate examples of mosaic decorations
can still be distinguished on the floors
over which the buildings stood, and some of
the Roman sweat-baths have been preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>almost intact; the ancient methods of producing
their heated vapours may be solved easily.
At one point within the walls was discovered
a trench holding fourteen sarcophagi lying
end to end in a long row. Of these several
have been transferred to the museums. When
found, all had been opened and it was impossible
to distinguish to whom they belonged,
because only two bore inscriptions, one Christian
and one Pagan.</p>

<p>On a slight hill back of the ruined city
stands the little stone house of the care-taker,
embellished with cut-stone work from the
buildings of old Salona. In the garden, at the
rear, a Roman pergola has been restored in its
entirety and over it climbs a rose-vine covered
with blooming red ramblers&mdash;an attractive
modern adaptation of an ancient Roman decorative
feature.</p>

<p>Immediately after the fall of Salona in 639
the inhabitants sought refuge on some of the
neighbouring islands; then, under the leadership
of Severus, they descended upon Spalato
and encamped within the walls of Diocletian’s
palace, finally erecting buildings and more
substantial dwellings, which accounts for the
material change of the interior aspect of the
palace. For the very good reason that nine
and one-half acres was rather a small area to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>accommodate any great number of people, the
town of Spalato soon spread outside of its
original walls. It was visited by the great
Venetian expedition under Pietro Orseola II
in 998, and was compelled to take the oath of
allegiance. Internal religious controversies
occurred from this time on, until the murderous
Tartars, in pursuit of King Bela in 1241,
sacked the town and put to death all whom
they found in their path. But Spalato arose
bravely from the blight of her misfortunes,
and in 1327 revolted against Venice, was absorbed
by Hungary and, thirty years later, revolted
against the latter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the changes it has undergone,
Diocletian’s palace has been handed
down to us, and still holds its place as the most
magnificent specimen of the domestic architecture
of the Romans. And, strangely enough,
its Temple of Jupiter has, for fourteen centuries,
served as the Spalatine house of worship
of the Christian religion, that religion
which the builder of this same temple tried so
hard to obliterate.</p>

<p class="hang50">From Spalato to Zara&mdash;Chief Objects of Interest in the Capital
of Dalmatia&mdash;The Story of St. Simeon&mdash;The Five Fountains&mdash;Fragments
of Roman Occupation.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was twelve o’clock of a soft summer
night when the sharp, hooded prow of the
<em>Graf Wurmbrand</em> backed away from the
<em>molo</em> at Spalato, swung around in the darkness
and headed out into the black beyond, on
her five hour run along the coast to Zara. Her
cabins and after decks were ablaze with electric
bulbs, but forward of the bridge all was
inky darkness, for the pilot of this, the fastest
boat of the Adriatic coast service, took the
matter more seriously than the passengers and
allowed no glare to dim the sharpness of his
vision while his charge sped northward between
the islands, responding gracefully to the
twirl of the wheel.</p>

<p>When our eyes had become accustomed to
peering out into the darkness, for it is almost
as beautiful to ride at night through these
channels as it is in the daytime and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>that reason we eschewed our berths, those of
us who had remained on deck could distinguish,
as we passed, the silhouette of the
island of Kraglievaz, or King’s Seat, upon
which Bela IV secluded himself from the pursuit
of the Tartars. Then we plowed through
a veritable shoal of islands and passed an isolated
rock, formerly crowned by the Benedictine
monastery of St. Arcangelo. Farther
along, near the famous headland of La Planca
(the Promontorium Diomedis of the Romans),
we passed a little chapel, built by a
thankful mariner who, while sailing up the
coast with a cargo of Malvasia wine, suffered
shipwreck on the rocks and made ingenious use
of his cargo to mix the mortar with which to
bind the stones of this little monument of
appreciation of his rescue.</p>

<p>At this point we also crossed an arm of the
open sea, and then sped on between the island
of Zlarin and the mainland. Beyond Zlarin
lies the town of Sebenico, founded by pirates
who, from their caves in the surrounding
mountains, scanned the sea for ships. Waxing
in boldness they founded a colony on the shore,
which they surrounded with a fortification or
palisade. From the Croatian name for “palisade”
(“Sibne”) is derived the name of the
town, Sebenico.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<p>At daybreak, had there been in the distance
a few scattered palm trees and a stretch of
sandy beach, we might easily have imagined
ourselves in equatorial latitudes. The rays of
the sun tinted the mainland and the islands in
hues of saffron; there was scarcely a ripple
on the deep turquoise-coloured water. We
steamed up through the Canal di Zara, a channel
three miles in width, between the mainland
and the mountainous island of Ugliano, and
at five in the morning the lines of the <em>Graf
Wurmbrand</em> were made fast to the <em>molo</em> at
Zara.</p>

<p>This old town was the ancient Jadera, even
then in allegiance with Rome, where a Roman
colony was established in 78 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> Many years
later it was brought under the powerful yoke
of the Venetians and numerous fragments of
both periods still remain. The Zara of to-day
is world famous for being the home of the
maraschino industry, the delicious cordial distilled
from the juice of the wild cherries which
grow in abundance on the slopes of the neighbouring
limestone hills, and you have never
tasted <em>real</em> maraschino if you haven’t tapped
the till in Zara.</p>

<p>In the evenings, the esplanade along the
stone quay, which skirts the harbour, is alive
with promenading Dalmatians of all classes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>while one of the best military bands to be heard
in a week’s travel plays inimitable music at
the shore end of the <em>molo</em>. Except for the
dearth of tourists and the absence of the incessantly
gliding gondolas the water front at
Zara almost resembles a scene along the Grand
Canal in Venice.</p>

<p>The chief objects of interest in Zara seemed
to be ourselves, and I do not remember ever
having been stared at more than here in the
capital of Dalmatia and barely off the beaten
track of English-speaking travellers. The
townspeople ran into each other, not to mention
lamp-posts and stone walls, in their attempts
to satisfy their curiosity. While we ate
in the pretty little open-air café of the hotel
the waiters stood around with their mouths
open, their eyes as large as billiard balls, and
the groups of Austrian army officers allowed
their food to grow cold and their beer to become
flat as they watched, none too furtively,
our every move.</p>

<p class="caption">THE WATER FRONT, ZARA.</p>
</div>

<p>But there are many things to see in Zara, of
which the natives seem to take little account
when there happens to be a stranger in town.
One of these objects worthy of inspection is
the body of St. Simeon, the patron saint of the
town, and the story of how he came into office
(shall I say?) is interesting, and rather unique.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometime during the thirteenth century, the
exact date is unknown, a caravel put into the
port of Zara after a helpless battle with wind
and wave on the Adriatic. On board was a
nobleman returning from the Crusades, who
asked that he might deposit in the cemetery
the body of his brother which he had hoped
to convey to his home for burial. While his
ship was undergoing repairs the nobleman himself
fell ill and died. Upon examining his documents
it was discovered that the body of the
alleged “brother” was that of none other than
St. Simeon, the prophet who had held the infant
Christ in his arms. The people of Zara,
having come unexpectedly into the possession
of so precious a relic, exhibited the body in the
collegiate church of St. Maria, where it proved
its sanctity by working miracles, and its fame
quickly spread throughout the country.</p>

<p>For some years the body was allowed to remain
in the church for the want of an appropriate
shrine in which it might be preserved.
In 1371 Lewis of Hungary, accompanied by
his mother and Elizabeth, his wife, came on a
visit to Zara. After viewing the saintly body
of Simeon, Elizabeth, desiring to take with
her some memento of the wonder-worker,
broke a finger from one of the hands and hid
it in her bosom. For this sacrilege St. Simeon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>punished her by striking her blind on the spot,
caused her hand, the one with which she had
taken the finger, to wither, and caused her
breast, where she had hid the relic, to mortify.
Frantic with the sudden loss of her sight, Elizabeth
tried to flee from the church but was unable
to find the door. She groped her way
back to the casket, fell upon her knees and
replaced the stolen finger, which immediately
united itself to the proper hand, the Queen’s
sight being restored the same moment. Again
Elizabeth implored the forgiveness of the Saint
and promised to present him with a silver
casket in which his body might repose more
comfortably than she thought it did in its
wooden resting place. The story goes that this
promise so reconciled the prophet that Elizabeth’s
breast was healed forthwith and her
withered hand was made whole.</p>

<p>When the Queen returned to her home she
communicated with certain nobles in Zara with
regard to the casket, and in 1377 her agents
commissioned one Francesco d’Antonio di
Milano, a goldsmith, to proceed with the work.
By the time he had completed his task, three
years later, he had used nearly a thousand
pounds of silver metal, and he received twenty-eight
thousand ducats as pay from Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Nearly two hundred years passed before any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>attempt was made to raise funds for the erection
of a suitable temple in which to place permanently
the silver sarcophagus containing the
body of so famous a saint; money was slow
in coming in, and in 1600, after the façade of
the building was half finished, the work was
abandoned.</p>

<p>In 1543 the old church of St. Maria was
demolished to make room for new fortifications.
The silver casket was then given to the
nuns for safe-keeping, while the body of the
Saint had been transferred to its original ark
of cypress wood and left in a little chapel
near by.</p>

<p>At length Archbishop Garzadori proposed
that the body be replaced in the silver casket
and taken to the church of St. Stefano which
stood in the immediate vicinity. About this
time an outbreak of the plague tended to remind
the superstitious of their neglect of the
body of St. Simeon and a new chancel was
hurriedly placed in the church, the silver ark,
which had been found stained and tarnished
in the nunnery, was repaired by a goldsmith
of the name of Benedetto Libani, and on May
16th, 1632, the translation of the body took
place amid public rejoicing. Since that date
St. Simeon has reigned as the patron saint of
Zara.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the historical landmarks in the town
of Zara, the Cinque Pozzi, or Five Fountains,
constitute one of the most prominent. They
stand in a row in front of a broad flight of
stone steps, which lead up to a shady park
overlooking the docks and part of the city.
These fountains are more like cisterns and
from them the poorer inhabitants still draw
their water, carrying it away in great jars upon
their heads. They were designed by Sammichieli,
an architect of Verona, and built in 1574.
To them the water is conducted from sources
outside the city, first passing through a rather
elaborate system of subterranean filtration.
An architect living in Zara has in his possession
a copy of a plan of these filters as designed
by Sammichieli himself.</p>

<p>Included in the manifestations of the Roman
occupancy of Zara are the fragments of an
ancient temple dedicated to Juno Augusta,
the consort of Emperor Augustus. These
fragments had been built into the old church
of St. Donato, erected in the ninth century.</p>

<p>And you will be loth to leave Zara, for at
every turn you discover something that seems
to be more interesting than that which you saw
before. The streets are clean and although
the rays of the sun are uncomfortably hot, the
narrow thoroughfares are always shady and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>invite you to wander aimlessly up and down,
lingering here and there before the shop windows.
In the evening, while the band plays,
the scene along the quay is one of gayety, and
you will be inspired to make the resolution,
that, if ever again you happen along the eastern
coast of the Adriatic, Zara will be sure to
receive from you a more lengthy visit.</p>

<p class="center">THE GULF OF QUARNERO</p>


<p class="hang50">The Home of the Bora&mdash;Fiume&mdash;Abbazia&mdash;The Home of the
Torpedo&mdash;Descendants of the Uscocs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> summer or fall it is a pleasant boat trip
of six hours from Zara to Fiume, which is prettily
situated at the north-eastern end of the
Gulf of Quarnero. But in the winter and
early spring, at which seasons the “Bora,” or
north-east wind, is prevalent, keep an eye on
the barometer! It is at this north-eastern end
of the Gulf, in the mountains back of Fiume,
that this dreaded wind is born. Accumulating
velocity with every blast, it sweeps down upon
the sea with relentless fury, carrying everything
before it, overturning carts, upsetting
horses in the streets and putting a quietus, for
the time being, on all navigation within range.</p>

<p>The western channels and the western slopes
of the islands are better protected from the
destructive gusts of the “Bora,” but the channels
nearest to the Croatian coast are swept by
its full fury. Along the eastern shores of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>channels the soil is rendered as sterile as the
sands of the desert, for the wind cuts the spray
from the surface of the water and carries it
inland in great clouds, completely obscuring
the shore line from the sea, and destroying the
tender sprouts of early cereals by depositing
upon them the injurious salty sediment. In
1873, while a train was rounding one of the
many curves on the line from Agram to Fiume,
the “Bora” came up suddenly and blew it
from the rails.</p>

<p>The little town of Segna seems to suffer the
most from this wind; at any rate many of the
stories of the extraordinary violence with which
it blows originated there. Some historians tell
us that in Segna during the raging of a
“Bora” it is unsafe to venture out-of-doors;
that it lifts weak or aged adults and little children
from the ground and dashes them against
the walls of the houses; that those who are
obliged to go to the basin where the ships lie
must crawl snake-like on the ground to avoid
being picked off their feet and hurled into the
sea. It is a common occurrence for horses
heavily loaded to be thrown down in the
market-place of Segna, and although the roofs
of all houses are weighted with stones they
are often lifted and carried away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it’s an ill wind that blows nobody
good” and, therefore, the “Bora” was
hardly considered wholly unwelcome by the
pirates, the Uscocs, who once infested the
islands of the bay, finding their safety in the
dangers of navigation thereabouts which deterred
better ships but less able seamen from
hunting them down and sinking their puny
craft.</p>

<p>Strangely incongruous with its soporific atmosphere
is the bustle and business of Fiume.
Finally united to Hungary in 1870, Fiume
has grown from a mere seaport town to a
thriving manufacturing and shipping city of
thirty-nine thousand inhabitants. To-day it
is in the class with the Austrian city of Trieste,
on the opposite side of the Istrian Peninsula;
one of the most cosmopolitan ports in the
world. The scene along the docks is interesting,
for Fiume is the home port of fleets of
coasters which ply up and down the Adriatic,
of great steel cargo and passenger ships making
scheduled sailings to the Levant, to the
coasts of Africa, to the Straits Settlements and
the Far East, to North and South America.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_285"><img src="images/i_285.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="363" /></a>
<p class="caption">VIA ANDRASSY, FIUME.</p>
</div>

<p>A few miles to the west of Fiume, nestling
snugly on the edge of the bay at the foot of
massive Mount Maggiore, lies a fashionable
little sea-side resort, patronized by the upper
crust of Austrian aristocracy, Abbazia. Here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>under the trees or on the porch of the Casino,
the élite of the land sips its liquor and smokes
its slender cigarettes while the military band
interprets the latest Viennese musical success.</p>

<p>And almost within an arm’s reach of Abbazia,
just a few yards off in the bay, is one
end of the target range of an ever-busy manufacturing
plant, whose product has tended
more to evolutionize warfare than any device
ever invented, the Whitehead torpedo factory.
On this range the great fish-like instruments
of destruction are tested thoroughly, their parts
adjusted and tested again, to assure their deadliness,
before shipment to the arsenals of the
powers supplied. At one end of the range
is the firing station, and in a long line, stretching
away toward Abbazia, are the several floating
targets, each manned by a signalman with
a red flag, under the centres of which the torpedoes
must eventually be made to dart before
they are ready for delivery. Industrious little
power boats shoot up and down the bay collecting
the “dead” torpedoes, which, having
spent their energy, turn finally from their
course and splash about on the surface of the
water like wounded porpoises, to tow them
back to the launching station for an adjustment
of their parts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>What if a torpedo would come to the surface
prematurely and hit one of the targets? Some
do, and rip great holes in the wooden decks,
causing the signalmen to execute some nimble
acrobatics, but there is never any danger from
explosion, because the “war-heads” of the torpedoes
have not yet been put in place; all they
carry are the steering-gears and the little compressed
air engine. Once in a while, owing
to a serious defect in the steering-gear, one
will run amuck a few seconds after it has been
discharged. Then is the time for the launches
to be on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i>, for there is no telling what
direction the torpedo will take. One of them
once made a bee-line for the stone wall which
skirts the bay in front of the factory. Like a
leaping salmon it mounted this at one bound,
bounced along the top for a few yards, demolishing
stone-work and making the wall appear
as if it had been struck by a thirteen-inch shell,
and then plunged into the bay, tearing around
this way and that until it made its final death-leap
and lay peacefully upon the surface of
the water. Then, like a naughty but remorseful
boy, it was towed back and given a good
spanking in the form of an overhauling of its
parts.</p>

<p>In the city of Fiume there are many types&mdash;Croatians,
Austrian army and navy officers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>Italians, Dalmatians, Germans, Englishmen&mdash;and
all work hard accumulating fortunes, large
or small as the case may be; but those who
seem to be amassing the largest private estates
in proportion to their labours, if one may
judge from their daily net receipts, are the
piratical porters of the town, who swoop down
from all points of the compass upon the unsuspecting
traveller. It is safe to say that these
are the lineal descendants of the Uscocs of old,
having only adopted more modern methods of
piracy than those employed by their ancestors,&mdash;for
from whom else might they have
inherited their predatory proclivities? These
<i>must</i> have been handed down from father to
son, for they are too well developed to admit
of mere accidental discovery. Every time one
of these porters looks at your luggage he commits
petty larceny, in thought, if not in deed.
The charge for carrying a small grip from
the dock to the hotel, a distance of a hundred
feet, may be any amount from the equivalent
of twenty-five cents up, and the wise traveller
is gulled but once. Some one tried to explain
to me why the Fiume porters were allowed
to charge any amount they pleased, but it
seemed a very unsatisfactory excuse. Suffice
it to say that the price demanded for carrying
one grip is one <em>krone</em>, with one, two or three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span><em>kronen</em> added, according to the nationality of
the patron. For example: to carry one grip
for an Austrian, one <em>krone</em>; for a German,
two <em>kronen</em>; for an Englishman, three <em>kronen</em>;
for an American, four <em>kronen</em>. It seems that
the farther away one lives the more it costs
one to have one’s baggage transferred in
Fiume. A Chinaman with two grips would
go bankrupt in this town in no time.</p>

<p>With a farewell salute to Fiume and her
activity, manufacturing, shipping and piratical,
we sailed out across the waters of the harbour
of this, the western sea-gate to the Balkan
Peninsula, homeward bound.</p>

<p>After having wandered over this virgin
touring territory, a territory with a future as
well as with an eventful past, a territory of
big things in war and in peace; after having
revelled in its type-pictures and its remarkable
scenery, mingled with its unsophisticated peoples
and marvelled at its history and its struggles
for mere existence, we were struck with
thoughts, as we came suddenly from the land
of simplicity upon the preying porters of
Fiume, at once akin to and conflicting with
those of a certain author, who, in an early
book of travel, concludes the narration of an
experience as follows:</p>

<p>“After having walked eleven hours without
having traced the print of a human foot, to
my great comfort and delight, I saw a man
hanging upon a gibbet; my pleasure at the
cheering prospect was inexpressible, for it convinced
me that I was in a civilized country.”</p>
